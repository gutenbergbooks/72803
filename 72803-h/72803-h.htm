<p class="ph3">A MIDNIGHT ALARM.</p>


<p>“O-u-e-e!”</p>

<p>Piercing and shrill, from the tense stillness of the night
sounded this eerie wail.</p>

<p>In terrified alarm, Sam Bowser rose in his bed to his
elbow.</p>

<p>As he remained thus, trying to decide whether the awesome
shriek was a cry of distress from some human
being or was an imagining of his mind, his wife awoke.</p>

<p>“What was that?” she gasped, excitedly.</p>

<p>“You heard it, too?”</p>

<p>“I—I thought I heard something. It sounded like the
very soul being drawn from some woman. U-ugh! It
makes me shiver to think of it.”</p>

<p>“Well, there aren’t any women nearer than thirty
miles, except you, so it couldn’t be that.”</p>

<p>“But some one might be carrying a woman off or murdering
her. Just because Amy Hawks is the nearest one
we know of, doesn’t make it so there mightn’t be some
poor creature being killed.”</p>

<p>To this, the man made no response, and together they
listened intently for a repetition of the awful wail.</p>

<p>“Guess it must have been some coyote got kicked while
he was smelling round the cattle. This is the fi——”</p>

<p>But the words literally stuck in Bowser’s mouth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span></p>

<p>Again the shriek, bloodcurdling in its gruesomeness,
rang out ere he could finish what he purposed to say.</p>

<p>This time there was no mistaking the cry.</p>

<p>It seemed to come from a woman in awful distress and
to be close at hand.</p>

<p>“There’s some mischief afoot!” exclaimed the man,
as, heedless of his wife’s protests, he leaped from his
bed, seized his rifle and rushed to the door.</p>

<p>Yet, when he threw it open, there was nothing to be
seen!</p>

<p>The silence and the darkness of the night were overwhelming—as
only the silence and darkness of the plains
of Arizona can be.</p>

<p>Sam Bowser was the owner of the Double Cross ranch.
With no neighbors nearer than thirty miles, he and his
wife, Sarah, lived in the home ranch house. This building
faced the South. To the right, and some sixty feet
distant, was the bunkhouse, where the cowpunchers
lived when not on the range. To the North and between
the two houses was a horse corral. Directly back of this
was a second corral for the cattle, so large that it seemed
more like a big pasture enclosed by barbed wire than a
yard.</p>

<p>Only the day before had Bowser’s men driven the pick
of his herds back to the home ranch in order that they
might be shipped away to the great cattle markets of the
Middle West.</p>

<p>Scarcely had the ranch owner opened the door than
lights blazed in the bunkhouse, followed an instant later
by the rush of the cowpunchers, as, guns in their hands,
they crept cautiously from their shanty to learn the cause
of the alarm.</p>

<p>“Steady, boys! Don’t go to shooting up the country!”
warned Bowser, running across the yard to join his men.</p>

<p>“What did you make of it, Sam?” demanded a tall,
leathery cowpuncher, who served as foreman.</p>

<p>“You’ve got me, Sandy. The missus ’lows it’s some
woman being murdered.”</p>

<p>“But there ain’t any women round here,” protested another
of the men, who had been christened “Pinky” by
his fellows because of his fondness for decorating his
saddle and bridle with anything of the color.</p>

<p>“That’s just what I told her,” declared the ranchman,
evidently glad to learn his opinion found support.
“But she ’lowed that didn’t make any difference, that one
or a dozen could be brought here. I sort of had an idea,
it might have been a coyote.”</p>

<p>“Wal, it warn’t no coyote,” drawled the third of the
boys attached to the Double Cross outfit, who revelled in
the title of Deadshot Pete. “I been on these plains too
long not to know every tone and variation of the songs
them sneaks sing.”</p>

<p>“Then what was it?” demanded Sandy. “Seems to
me, if it was some man or woman being done to death,
they’d keep up more of a continuous yelling.”</p>

<p>“Unless it’s too late,” commented Deadshot, significantly.</p>

<p>This suggestion that perhaps the gruesome wails which
had roused them all from their sleep might have been the
dying protests or appeals for help of some human being
caused the men to become silent.</p>

<p>“Don’t see how we can do any good so long as we
don’t hear the thing again to give us a definite idea of its
direction,” remarked the ranchman, after a period of several
minutes peering into the darkness and listening had
been productive of neither sight nor sound. “Guess we’d
better get back to our bunks and wait till daylight.”</p>

<p>“Reckon you’re right, Sam,” returned his foreman.
“It’s either too late, as Deadshot says, or we must hear
it again so’s we can get our bearings.”</p>

<p>But neither the owner nor the outfit of the Double
Cross was destined to get any more sleep that night!</p>

<p>While talking, the men had been looking toward the
South.</p>

<p>Chancing to turn so that he was facing the cattle corral,
Pinky suddenly uttered an exclamation of wild fear, then
clutched Sandy by the arm, wheeling him about, as he
pointed Northward with trembling hand.</p>

<p>Amazed at such action on the part of their bunkmate,
the others followed his gaze.</p>

<p><i>Apparently floating through the air, directly above the
cattle corral, was a white spectre!</i></p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

</div>

<p class="ph3">THE RAID.</p>


<p>“Ghosties!” gasped Sandy, in a voice scarcely above
a whisper.</p>

<p>“No wonder we couldn’t place it—but I knew it warn’t
no coyote,” asserted Deadshot.</p>

<p>For several minutes the men gazed at the awesome
thing as it flitted hither and thither.</p>

<p>“By the blood of my mother! But I’m glad the crittur
never took it into its head to visit us on the range,”
breathed Pinky.</p>

<p>“Same here,” chorused Sandy and Deadshot.</p>

<p>“It means trouble—you see if it doesn’t,” continued
the latter. “The only other time I ever see anything
like it was the night before the Piutes dashed down on
old man Turner’s ranch and killed all but me and a low-down
gambler called Crooked Joe.”</p>

<p>This assertion that the eerie spectre floating before their
eyes was not the first one he had seen instantly claimed
the ears of his companions, though they kept their gaze
riveted on the apparition.</p>

<p>“What was <i>that</i> one like?” breathed Pinky.</p>

<p>“It was all lit up, like fire. The Piutes said it was a
curse put out by their Medicine Man.”</p>

<p>“But how’d you manage to get away from the Injuns
and escape the massacre?” inquired Sandy, in whom
Deadshot’s tales of his experiences always aroused suspicion
of their truthfulness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span></p>

<p>“Me and Crooked Joe sloped as soon as the light in
the sky was discovered. Mark my word, man dear, <i>every
time you sees anything in the air like ghosties, it means
trouble</i>!”</p>

<p>“Well, you aren’t going to get out of it this time by
digging out,” broke in the ranch owner, who had been
listening with increasing alarm to his cowpuncher’s story,
and feared the effect it might have upon the rest of his
men. “I need you all to-morrow to get the bunch to the
loading station. So don’t think you can sneak off.”</p>

<p>“We can’t eh?” demanded Deadshot. “Who’s a going
to stop <i>me</i> if I want to go?”</p>

<p>“I am, with this rifle I’ve got in my hands,” returned
the owner of the ranch, calmly. “I don’t want any
trouble. But I won’t stand for any of this nonsense
about spirits, trouble and running away. If any one of
you tries to get a pony from that corral to-night, I’ll put
a shell into him. Just keep that in your heads.”</p>

<p>The unexpected turn of affairs had amazed the other
cowboys, and, forgetting all about the spectre, they
watched the ranchman and his helper.</p>

<p>“You kinder got the drop on me, Sam,” growled the
cowpuncher, “so I ’low I’ll do just as you say. Besides,
I didn’t mean nothing anyhow.”</p>

<p>“All right, Deadshot. No hard feelings. Let’s go over
to the cattle corral and see what this white thing is.”</p>

<p>“What, go chasing a ghostie?” gasped Sandy, the very
thought of any man daring to investigate an apparition
seeming akin to sacrilege to his superstitious mind.</p>

<p>“Sure. Why not? It won’t eat you.”</p>

<p>“Well, <i>you</i> can go if you like. But I ain’t particular,”
returned the foreman. “That ain’t any part of my job.”</p>

<p>The necessity for any one to go, however, was suddenly
obviated.</p>

<p>With an abruptness that was in keeping with its coming,
the spectre vanished.</p>

<p>“Skulls and crossbones! Did you see that? It just
floated away and we looking straight at it!” moaned
Sandy.</p>

<p>The uncanniness of the apparition’s disappearance impressed
even the ranch owner, and he was wondering as
to the course he should pursue to reassure his men, when
Pinky whispered:</p>

<p>“Let’s go into the house before the blamed thing lights
on us here!”</p>

<p>The thought that the mysterious spectre might appear
face to face with them unnerved these men of the plains—men
to whom danger in any tangible form was a delight—and
they were on the point of dashing into their bunkhouse
in utter panic when they were recalled to their
normal selves.</p>

<p>Simultaneously with the disappearance of the spectre
came a pitching and swaying among the cattle, followed
instantly by terrified bellowing and the wildest confusion.</p>

<p>“The ghosties cast a spell on the cattle!” whimpered
Sandy.</p>

<p>“Didn’t I say it meant trouble?” demanded Deadshot,
exulting at the very evident fulfilment of his prophecy.</p>

<p>“Don’t stand there talking! Get your ponies and come
on! We’ve got our work cut out for us! What it means
I don’t know. But I <i>do</i> know, if we don’t steady those
cattle down lively, they’ll stampede—and then we’ll have
a merry time!” declared the ranchman, leading the way
to the horse corral.</p>

<p>A moment, fearing that the animals had, indeed, been
cursed, held the cowpunchers inactive. Then, their lifelong
training on the plains coming to the fore, they followed
their employer and were soon racing to the terror-stricken
cattle.</p>

<p>Their fear increasing with every moment, the animals
were plunging and lowing, the crashing of their horns
sounding like the barking of pistols above the dull roar
of the pounding of their hoofs.</p>

<p>“There must be wolves in amongst ’em!” yelled Sandy,
riding up close to Bowser. “It’s breaking out all over
the corral, not in just one place.”</p>

<p>“Well, whatever it is, we’ve got to quiet the cattle,
or I won’t have one fit to ship away. Get busy, boys!”</p>

<p>But just as the ranchman finished speaking, Pinky let
out a yell.</p>

<p>“Look, right in the middle of the corral! The ghostie
again!” he cried.</p>

<p>Turning their eyes in the direction indicated, the
horsemen beheld the same white form seemingly floating
over the heads of the cattle.</p>

<p>“It must be the Old Nick himself!” moaned Sandy.
“There’ll be no quieting them critturs, Sam, with that
thing hovering over them.”</p>

<p>Too well did the ranch owner realize this fact—and he
also realized that unless he did something to remove the
suggestion of the supernatural from the mysterious apparition,
he would be unable to control either men or
cattle.</p>

<p>Just what the thing was, he did not know. Yet, being
a man of an unimaginative mind, he decided to find out.</p>

<p>Without saying a word of his intentions to his assistants,
the owner of the Double Cross threw his rifle to his
shoulder, took a hurried sight at the spectral form and
pulled the trigger.</p>

<p>As the report rang out, the cowpunchers leaned forward
in their saddles, watching the form intently.</p>

<p>To shoot at a ghost required more courage—in view
of the traditions relating to ill-luck and curses such an
act brought down upon the head of one so rash—than
they possessed, and the cowboys fully expected some dire
punishment to be instantly meted out to their boss.</p>

<p>For an intense moment, there was no apparent result
from the bullet sent at the floating form.</p>

<p>Then a mocking laugh rent the air, and the white
spectre vanished as completely as before!</p>

<p>“There’s more human than spook to that voice!” exclaimed
Bowser.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span></p>

<p>“Skulls and crossbones! I have it! It’s a raid!” cried
Sandy.</p>

</div>

<p class="ph3">THE RANCHMAN’S VOW.</p>


<p>The ranchman’s assertion that the spectre was of
human invention and their foreman’s declaration that
it was but a ruse to cover the raiding of the cattle, produced
an instantaneous reaction upon the cowpunchers.</p>

<p>“By my saddle, you’re right!” assented Deadshot.
“That’s what the trouble is. Somebody’s trying to lift
the cattle. I’ve seen ’em started on a stampede too many
times not to recognize the symptoms. And here we’ve
been afraid of a spook, giving the thieving cusses just
the chance they planned. Say, Sam, I wouldn’t blame
you for sacking the whole kit and boodle of us!” he
added, his shame and contrition evident in his voice.</p>

<p>“Don’t waste time being sorry, get busy and help calm
the cattle!” returned his employer. “You boys ride
round ’em, and get ’em to milling, if you can. I want
to keep my eyes open for another sight of Mr. Spook.”</p>

<p>Deeply chagrined to think they had allowed such a
trick to be played on them, for they realized that when
the story got out, the Double Cross outfit would be the
laughing stock of all the other cowmen in the region,
the cowboys set about their work with a will.</p>

<p>But the job was too big for them!</p>

<p>Even before they had ridden fifty yards along the
barbed wire fence, they learned that their efforts would
prove fruitless.</p>

<p>With crashing of horns, snorting and bellowing, a
bunch of the cattle dashed out onto the plains, the outlines
of their bodies just visible as they plunged along.</p>

<p>As though this breaking away from the herd had been
prearranged, other bunches raced away into the darkness.</p>

<p>“The fence has been cut! The fence has been cut!”
roared Sandy, at the top of his lungs.</p>

<p>“There’s no use trying to hold the critturs. Come
on back to Sam and we’ll find out what he wants us to
do,” returned Deadshot.</p>

<p>Aware that with the cattle dashing away in all points
of the compass, it was an impossible task for them to
hope to round them up or even to try to hold the ones
that had not already gone, Pinky and Deadshot rode back
with their foreman until they came to the ranch owner.</p>

<p>“What’s to do?” asked Pinky, after the fact that the
barbed wire fence had been cut in several places had been
reported to Bowser.</p>

<p>“Lay for Mr. Spook!” snapped the owner of the
Double Cross. “I’ll give any one of you a thousand
dollars for his dead body! We’ll each of us take one side
of the corral and patrol it.”</p>

<p>“But we haven’t got out rifles, only our six shooters,”
interrupted Deadshot.</p>

<p>“Then ride for all your worth to the bunkhouse and
get them! While you’re there, just tell the missus what’s
up. Then hurry back. And say, bring some torches,”
he shouted, as the thought that lights might prove useful
came to him, for his man was already racing for the guns.</p>

<p>“That’s some trick,” muttered Sandy, while they
waited. “Wonder was there more than one of ’em?”</p>

<p>“Sure,” asserted Pinky. “There was probably three
or four of ’em working on the fence, cutting the wires,
while the other played ghostie!”</p>

<p>This opinion of the numerical strength of the Midnight
Raiders, which found ready acceptance from Bowser and
Sandy, was later to be proved false, however!</p>

<p>They were destined to learn that the daredevil cattle
thief was a lone man!</p>

<p>“That being the case, aren’t we wasting time trying
for a shot at them?” demanded the foreman. “They
probably made their getaway along with that first bunch
of cattle.”</p>

<p>“Maybe you’re right, Sandy,” assented the ranchman.
“But I’ve got a sort of hunch that spook will show himself
once more.”</p>

<p>And the owner of the Double Cross was right—though
the method chosen by the spectral raider to disclose his
whereabouts was different from that which Bowser expected!</p>

<p>Lingering at the houses only long enough to make a
hurried report to the ranchman’s wife and then to get
the rifles and torches, Deadshot was soon back with his
companions.</p>

<p>“Here, everybody take a torch and hurry to your
posts,” ordered Bowser, as his man rode up. “Sandy,
you go to the West side; Pinky to the North; Deadshot
to the East, and I’ll take the South. Keep, your eyes
peeled—and <i>remember the thousand dollars</i>!”</p>

<p>Even as he spoke, the ranchman touched a match to
his torch and when the flame flared up, it threw the four
men into bold relief.</p>

<p>“How long shall we patrol?” asked Deadshot.</p>

<p>“Till I wave my torch in the air. Then ride to the
house. We’ll get some grub and pick up the trail as soon
as it gets daylight.”</p>

<p>Before any of the quartet could take up the task of
patrolling the cut fence, however, the cattle thief made
himself known.</p>

<p>Bang! boomed a gun from the North.</p>

<p>In amazement, the cowboys wheeled.</p>

<p>And even as they did, a bullet whistled through the air,
carrying the sombrero from Bowser’s head.</p>

<p>“Douse the torches! It gives ’em a line on us!” cried
Deadshot in alarm, lest a second shell might find its
man.</p>

<p>No urging did the ranch owner or any of his men
need to make them obey. The shot had been too well
aimed and had come too close to its mark for them to
care to make targets of themselves for gunmen who
could show such skill at night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span></p>

<p>But, as they hurled the torches to the ground, the
ranchman rose in his stirrups.</p>

<p>“You may have the drop on me now!” he roared, shaking
his fist in wrathful impotence in the direction whence
the shot had come. “But just wait! <i>Nobody can steal
Sam Bowser’s cattle, scare his men, shoot at him and get
away with it!</i></p>

<p>“<i>So long as there is a breath of life in my body, I’ll
trail you—and I’ll run you to your lair</i>, mark my word!”</p>

<p>The tone in which the owner of the Double Cross
spoke, the dim outline of his tall figure as he swayed in his
saddle, his arm beating the air in his fury, as he vowed
revenge against the miscreants who had stampeded his
cattle and tried to murder him, afforded an effect dramatic
in the extreme.</p>

<p>Yet, scarcely had the last words left his lips than
again a gun barked and a bullet “pinged” viciously as it
sailed over his head!</p>

<p>“Man, dear, but this is <i>too</i> much!” hissed the ranchman.
“After them, boys!</p>

<p>“<i>We’ll hit their trail and stay on it till the last skulking
coyote of ’em is furnishing food for the vultures!</i>”</p>

<p class="ph3">PREPARATIONS FOR PURSUIT.</p>


<p>As the cowboys, who knew him so well, heard the grim
words uttered by the doughty ranchman, they realized
that he would keep his vow of trailing the cattle thieves
until he had, indeed, run them to their lair.</p>

<p>“We’re with you, Sam,” declared the foreman.</p>

<p>“That’s what!” chorused the other cowpunchers, while
Deadshot added: “There can’t no bunch of cowlifters
say they fooled Deadshot Pete—and got away with it!”</p>

<p>“But as I was a going to say,” continued Sandy, “it
strikes me we ought to round up the cattle and get ’em
back before we start out.”</p>

<p>“And let those sneaks get away while we’re doing it?”
snapped the owner of the Double Cross. “I’d rather get
<i>them</i> than all the cattle on my ranch!”</p>

<p>“That’s all right, Sam. I know how you feel; that is,
I know how I’d feel in your place. But they can’t get
away. We’ll trail ’em from Old Mex to Canada—if we
have to. A few hours’ start won’t do ’em any good, consequently.
So I say, what’s the use of letting the cattle
run wild?”</p>

<p>Already the animals which still remained inside the
raided corral were beginning to quiet down, the cause of
their disturbance having been removed, and the reasoning
of the foreman, therefore, was sound.</p>

<p>“Reckon Sandy’s right,” opined Pinky. “The critturs
won’t run very far on such a night, and unless there are
enough of the devils to follow each bunch, daylight won’t
find ’em more’n a mile or so from home.”</p>

<p>Several minutes the ranchman sat pondering, vouchsafing
no reply, while his men anxiously awaited any
word or movement that would indicate their boss’s intentions.</p>

<p>“That’s horse sense, I suppose,” he exclaimed, at last.
“But I hate to let the skulks think I care more for my
cattle than for getting the first opportunity to pump them
full of lead.”</p>

<p>“But ain’t it more businesslike to get both the cattle
<i>and</i> them?” inquired Sandy.</p>

<p>“It ain’t only the business end of it—it’s the effect it
will have on any other thieves who might take a flier at
cutting out your critturs, that you’ve got to think of,
Sam,” declared Deadshot.</p>

<p>“If you hit the trail without rounding up the cattle, so
many cowlifters would strike for the Double Cross there
wouldn’t be room for ’em on the home ranch. They’d
argue as how you couldn’t chase ’em all and so some of
’em would be able to drive off a bunch of critturs—and
for the value of the cattle they’d be willing to risk pursuit.
On the other hand, if you <i>first</i> round up the cattle
and <i>then</i> the cowlifters, getting both of them, there won’t
a dirty greaser nor a renegade buck dare to lift a finger
against the Double Cross outfit.”</p>

<p>Though this argument was crude and expressed in a
roundabout way, it’s meaning was perfectly clear.</p>

<p>“There’s no getting away from the fact that your reasoning
is sound, Deadshot,” responded Bowser. “So
we’ll wait till daylight and then round up the cattle.”
Though his reluctance to abandon immediate pursuit was
evidenced by his next words, as he added: “But I do
hate to let a man take a shot at me—let alone two—without
sending at least one shell in return.”</p>

<p>“If that’s all what’s worrying you, cheer up,” rejoined
Pinky. “You seem to be forgetting it was you who
started the game by taking a pot at the spook, when it
was floating around.”</p>

<p>“That’s so. I didn’t think of that,” returned the owner
of the Double Cross. And from the tone of his voice, his
men understood that the memory had appreciably tempered
his regret at being obliged to await the coming of
day before picking up the trail.</p>

<p>Quieter and quieter were the cattle in the raided corral
becoming, a sign the cowpunchers interpreted to mean
that the thieves had taken their departure after the last
shot. Consequently when the end of an hour brought no
fresh outbreak, the ranchman ordered his men to return
to the horse corral and gather together the things they
would require when they took up the pursuit.</p>

<p>To their amazement, when they rode into the yard,
there was not a light to be seen in either the home or
bunkhouse.</p>

<p>“You don’t suppose they’ve run off with the missus,
too?” suggested Pinky, in alarm.</p>

<p>But their anxiety as to the safety of Mrs. Bowser was
allayed even as the cowboy spoke.</p>

<p>“Who goes there?” demanded a voice, meant to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
stern, but in which there was an unmistakable tremor,
from the direction of the home front door.</p>

<p>“It’s all right, Sarah. It’s the boys and I,” hastily replied
her husband.</p>

<p>“Glory be! I’ve been scared almost out of my wits,”
exclaimed the woman.</p>

<p>“Scared?” repeated the men, in surprise.</p>

<p>“Yes. Just after Deadshot had left, I heard some one
ride into the yard. Thinking it was either him or one of
you, I rushed to the door. ‘Get inside if you don’t want
a bullet in your head!’ shouted a voice.”</p>

<p>“The fiend!” ejaculated the ranchman. “Did he shoot
at you?” he asked, anxiously.</p>

<p>“No. I didn’t give him the chance. When I found
it wasn’t any of you, I ducked down, slamming the door
and then I put the lights out.”</p>

<p>“But what became of the lights in the bunkhouse?” inquired
Sandy.</p>

<p>“I put them out, too,” returned Mrs. Bowser. “You
see, after I got over the first surprise and scare, my nerve
came back. I grabbed one of Sam’s guns, crept across
the yard, extinguished the lamps and then took up my
stand in the doorway, determined to take a shot at any
one else who came along.”</p>

<p>“Thank goodness, you had the foresight to speak before
shooting,” exclaimed her husband. “It was the last
thing I ever thought of your being on guard.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I may be a ‘’fraid cat,’ but I’m no fool,” asserted
the woman.</p>

<p>“That’s what you’re not, Sarah.”</p>

<p>“And there ain’t many other women with the nerve to
stand watch in the dark after they’ve been threatened,”
chimed in Sandy, in evident admiration of the bravery
displayed by the wife of the ranch owner.</p>

<p>During the conversation, the men had dismounted and
Pinky had relighted the lamps in the bunkhouse, which
they all entered, leaving their ponies standing, ready saddled
in case of emergency, by the door.</p>

<p>In the light of the lamps, Mrs. Bowser was able to
notice for the first time that her husband was hatless,
while the others all had their sombreros on.</p>

<p>“How’d you lose your hat, Sam?” she queried.</p>

<p>“Shot off,” replied the ranch owner, laconically. And
then, in response to her eager inquiries, he told her all
that had transpired in the cattle corral.</p>

<p>“Land sakes! How many of them do you suppose
there were?” she asked, as the narration of the exciting
incidents of the stampede, the disappearance of the mysterious
spectre and the shooting was concluded.</p>

<p>“There must have been four or five, at least, judging
from the number of openings there were in the fence,”
answered Pinky, eager to take part in the conversation.</p>

<p>But his remark was ignored in the attention given to
Deadshot.</p>

<p>“How many did you see riding through the yard, Mrs.
Bowser?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Only one.”</p>

<p>“Which means the gang has split up,” declared Sandy.</p>

<p>“Oh, you can’t tell anything by that,” asserted the
ranchman. “The fellow may have been cutting through
to join the rest of his bunch. Just stow your saddlebags
with grub, shells and cartridges, then look to your guns.
We must be off with the first break of day.”</p>

<p>In obedience, the cowpunchers set about making their
preparations for the pursuit, while the ranchman and his
wife crossed the yard to their home.</p>

<p>With the first flush of light in the East, the Double
Cross outfit rode forth to gather the strayed cattle, the
majority of which they found, as Pinky had prophesied,
within a few miles of the home-ranch.</p>

<p>Driving them back to the corral as quickly as possible,
the men took stock and found they had recovered all
but about fifty.</p>

<p>“That’s probably all the ‘lifters’ thought they could
handle and make their getaway,” exclaimed Sandy.</p>

<p>“More likely it means there weren’t so many of the
raiders as we think,” rejoined his boss. “Come on, now.
We’ll pick up the trail of this bunch of fifty and see where
that brings us.”</p>

<p>And with the promise to his wife that he would have
a couple of the cowboys from Henry Hawks’ ranch come
over to protect her and the cattle, the owner of the Double
Cross dashed away to pick up the trail of the Midnight
Raider, followed by his cowpunchers.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3">ON THE TRAIL.</p>


<p>Having learned, when they rounded up the stampeded
cattle, that the openings in the corral fence were on the
Southern side, Bowser and his men rode in that direction,
spreading out into a wide semicircle in order that they
might cover as much territory as possible, thereby locating
the more quickly the trail followed by the fifty head
which had not been found.</p>

<p>Back and forth they dashed, peering through the lessening
darkness for some sight of the missing animals and
straining their ears for a distant bellow or sound that
would give an idea to their whereabouts. And as the light
grew stronger and stronger, they were finally able to scan
the grass for the wide course where the cattle had trampled
it in their flight.</p>

<p>Several times, one or another of the searchers thought
they had found the trail, only to learn, after following it
for a few minutes, that it had been made by one of the
bunches of steers they had driven back.</p>

<p>Such was the position of the men that Deadshot was
on the extreme right, or Western, end of the line, while
Pinky, Sandy and the owner of the raided ranch stretched
away toward the East, in the order named.</p>

<p>As an hour of daylight went by without the discovery
of the track, the cowmen began to realize that the pursuit
of the cattlelifters would be no easy task, judging from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
the manner in which they had managed to conceal the
trail of fifty odd steers.</p>

<p>The realization, however, only made them the more
determined to pick up their track, and they settled down
to the work grimly.</p>

<p>At first they had ridden to and fro, rising now and
again in their stirrups to survey the plains about them.</p>

<p>Finding this method of no avail, the ranchman rode
over to Sandy and ordered him to begin and systematically
ride back and forth, advancing about three hundred yards
at each turn, telling him to pass the word to Pinky, who
would, in turn, inform the cowboy on the extreme West.</p>

<p>“If we can’t pick up the trail within five miles, we’ll
try the same tactics to the West and then to the North
and East. A man can’t put fifty steers in his pocket and
carry ’em off. The trail’s round here somewhere—and
it’s up to us to get busy and find it!” snapped Bowser,
as he whirled his pony and started back.</p>

<p>Before the new order could be communicated by Sandy
to Deadshot, however, the latter suddenly rose in his
stirrups and waved his arms wildly. But, failing to attract
the attention of his companions, he whipped out his
six-shooters and fired three times.</p>

<p>The barking of the guns produced the desired effect.</p>

<p>Wheeling their ponies, the others beheld their comrade
waving his hands to them in signal to ride to him.</p>

<p>“Have you found ’em?”</p>

<p>“Can you see ’em?”</p>

<p>“Did you shoot at any one?”</p>

<p>These questions were shouted at the cowboy who had
resorted to such startling methods to attract the attention
of his fellows.</p>

<p>“Do you think I’d be sitting here, waiting for you all
to come up if I’d sighted the cattle or fired at any one?”
demanded the cowpuncher, with fine scorn.</p>

<p>“Then what have you brought us over here for?” demanded
the owner of the Double Cross, his anger rising
as he began to suspect some trick on the part of his cowman.</p>

<p>“Now, don’t get het up, Sam,” chuckled Deadshot, with
a calmness that exasperated his bunkmates. “I ain’t seen
the cattle, as I said, but I’ve found their trail.”</p>

<p>“Where, man?” asked Pinky.</p>

<p>Ere the cowpuncher, who was enjoying to the full the
whetting of the other’s curiosity, could reply, however, the
men rode up to him.</p>

<p>There, stretching away as far as their eyes could see,
was a lane, some twenty feet wide, where the fleeing cattle
had trampled the grass down as cleanly as though the
path through the waving mesquite had been cut.</p>

<p>“Say, they certainly was going some,” exclaimed
Sandy, surveying the trail intently. “There must have
been at least four or five lifters at their heels to make
them steers hit it up like that.”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t sit there on your pony, arguing,” cut in
the ranchman. “Get down and search the ground for
horse-hoof tracks. Deadshot, you’ve always been bragging
how all-fired clever you were at picking out trails,
now show us if you can produce.”</p>

<p>This calling upon their comrade to “make good” in
the matter which formed his favorite topic for bragging,
brought smiles to the faces of the other cowboys, and
they sat back in their saddles preparatory to awaiting
the result of Deadshot’s scouting.</p>

<p>But their delight in the situation was rudely banished.</p>

<p>“Don’t sit there like a bunch of tenderfeet waiting for
a guide to drum up some game,” snapped Bowser. “Get
down and see if you can’t beat Deadshot to it. You want
to remember there’s such critturs as the Injuns call ‘heap
talk’ men.”</p>

<p>The owner of the raided ranch was not the one, however,
to leave all the work to his men, and even as he
spoke, he slipped from his saddle and was soon crawling
about on his hands and knees, peering at the trampled
grass, now and then pushing it aside as he scanned the
ground intently.</p>

<p>Spurred to action by the stinging words of their boss,
the three cowpunchers were doing the same thing, and for
several minutes the only sound audible was the panting of
the ponies as they strove to recover their wind after their
hard run.</p>

<p>“Must have been a shoeless broncho,” grumbled
Pinky, as no imprints of a horse’s hoof rewarded his
search.</p>

<p>“What did you expect, cavalry horses?” grunted
Deadshot, contemptuously. “You mark my word, before
we round up this gang of cowlifters, we’ll know
we’ve been on the trail!”</p>

<p>“For once, you’re talking sense,” grinned Sandy.</p>

<p>And chafing one another good-naturedly, the cowboys
continued their careful examination.</p>

<p>The task, however, of discovering any tracks of ponies
in the trampled and cloven-hoof cut ground proved too
great for the powers of the plainsmen and at last they
abandoned the attempt.</p>

<p>“It’s no use wasting any more time,” declared the
ranchman straightening up. “After all, it doesn’t make
any difference how many of the sneaks there were.
<i>Whether their band numbers two or a dozen, we’re
going to get them!</i> We’ve found their trail, that’s the
main thing.”</p>

<p>Chagrined to think he had not been able to “make
good” on his oft-repeated assertions of his ability to
track anything that went on legs, Deadshot was finally
obliged to mount his pinto and ride after the others, who
had mounted as soon as their boss had called the search
off, and were following the well-defined trail through the
grass.</p>

<p>“Where do you reckon the cowlifters are headed,
Deadshot?” asked Bowser, as the man overtook them.</p>

<p>Determined not to venture another opinion not founded
on good grounds, the cowpuncher stood up in his saddle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
and scanned the horizon ahead and to the right and left.</p>

<p>“Course, there ain’t no way of saying <i>for certain</i>,” he
began, “but, from what I know of cowlifters’ little ways
and the lay of these here plains——”</p>

<p>“Oh, cut it short! We ain’t no pleasure party being
toted round on a ‘rubberneck’ expedition,” growled
Pinky. “If you’ve <i>got</i> any idea, out with it.”</p>

<p>“As I was saying, from my knowledge of the tricks
of cattle raiders and these plains,” repeated Deadshot,
ignoring the interruption of his bunkmate, “I should
say the lifters were headed for the Sangammon bottoms.
They ain’t more than forty mile away, and there’s swamps
in there with grass high enough to hide an elephant.”</p>

<p>With various comments, the others received this suggestion
of the destination of the Midnight Raider, but
no one ventured an open contradiction.</p>

<p>“I reckon you’ve hit the mark this time, Deadshot,”
finally declared the ranch owner. “Though I’d hoped
the devils might have headed for the old Indian catacombs,
over in the Haunted Valley. It would be an all-fired
sight easier to rout them out from the tombs than
from the Sangammon swamps—and not so dangerous to
us. A man’s liable to strike a mudhole and be sucked
under before his pals could find him.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps Deadshot ain’t right,” suggested Pinky, to
whom his boss’ words brought up unexpected dangers.</p>

<p>But none of the others offered any comment, and in
silence, each man absorbed in his own thoughts, the
quartet, bound on their mission of revenge, swept along
over the trampled trail.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3">THE AVENGERS ARE DELAYED.</p>


<p>After an hour’s hard riding, the avengers came upon
the body of a steer lying in the trail.</p>

<p>The sight of the beast’s carcass seemed to madden the
owner of the Double Cross ranch.</p>

<p>“Look at that steer!” he yelled. “Never was a better
beef grazed the plains! And here it lies, dead from
being driven to death! Curse the fiends! <i>I’ll make them
suffer for raiding my cattle and then running them to
death!</i> After them, boys, don’t dally to examine, the
steer!”</p>

<p>“Easy, Sam, easy,” returned Sandy. “We’ll get ’em,
don’t worry. But it won’t do any harm to look at the
crittur. A few minutes won’t make any difference, and
we can tell from the heat of the body about how far the
lifters are ahead of us.”</p>

<p>Scarce a moment after the foreman had voiced this suggestion
was it before Deadshot was on the ground.</p>

<p>Still smarting under the sarcasm of his boss over his
failure to pick out the horse tracks when they struck the
trail, the cowboy had no sooner gained the side of the
prostrate steer than he was upon the mesquite. And,
even as Sandy spoke, with skilled hands, he was running
over the hide.</p>

<p>Eagerly the others awaited his verdict as to the time
the animal had been lying there.</p>

<p>But Deadshot spoke never a word.</p>

<p>“Well?” snapped his master, unable to restrain his
impatience when several minutes had passed and the cowboy
had not voiced his opinion.</p>

<p>“The body’s cold, Sam. But it ain’t stone cold.”</p>

<p>“Which means we’ve got some tall riding to do if we
expect to overhaul the ornery cusses before they lose
themselves in the swamp,” commented Pinky.</p>

<p>“That shows how much <i>you</i> know,” retorted the
ranchman. “We’re a good twenty mile from the home
corral, which is about half way to the bottoms, according
to Deadshot, and the steer is cold. Consequently, the
rest of the bunch must have passed here a good six hours
ago. No man, unless he had wings, could overtake the
cowlifters before they reached Sangammon, eh, Sandy?”</p>

<p>“Reckon you’ve got it about right, Sam,” returned his
foreman. “The raiders had all of six hours start, and
judging from the condition of this steer, here, they’re
running the critturs to the limit. If that animal ain’t
thirty pound poorer than when he left the corral, I don’t
know anything about cattle.”</p>

<p>“Then you think we haven’t gained on them?” demanded
Bowser, anxiously.</p>

<p>“None to speak of.”</p>

<p>“And, what’s more, we won’t be able to cut down
enough of their lead to make it worth while to kill our
ponies trying to,” interposed Deadshot. “Sandy’s telling
it straight when he says the devils are running the
steers for all they can. If we don’t come across more
than half of them before we get to the swamps, I’ll
miss my guess.”</p>

<p>A moment the ranchman pondered over these opinions.</p>

<p>“That being the case, then, there’s no use of keeping
to the trail,” he finally exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Why not?” demanded the others, surprised at the
words as they remembered their boss’s vow.</p>

<p>“Because we’ve got to go over to Henry Hawks’ and
get him to send some of his men to guard Sarah and
what’s left of my cattle in the corral.”</p>

<p>“And if you’ll take my advice, you’ll get old Hen to
join us with a couple or so of his boys,” asserted Deadshot.
“Rounding up these lifters ain’t going to be any
child’s play—especially when they’re hiding in the
swamps!”</p>

<p>“Righto,” rejoined Bowser. “The more of us, the
better. Come on, every jump we take along this trail now
is leading us farther from the Star and Moon. By striking
for it now, we ought to reach Hen’s in time for
dinner.”</p>

<p>Accordingly, the avengers abandoned for the time
being the trail made by the cattle thieves, and, turning
their ponies straight for the South, set out to obtain protection
for the lone woman left on the Double Cross
home ranch and reinforcements to their own numbers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
that they might the more quickly run the miscreants to
cover.</p>

<p>The tax upon their ponies incurred by galloping
through the tall grass and sagebrush was greater than in
following the cattle track and, in consequence, their speed
was less. Notwithstanding that handicap, however, they
made fairly good time, and the sun was directly overhead
when they cantered into the yard of the Star and Moon
home ranch.</p>

<p>At the sound of the rapid hoofbeats, Mrs. Hawks came
to the door.</p>

<p>“Well, Sam Bowser, if I’m not glad to see you,” she
exclaimed, cordially, as soon as she made out the identity
of the riders. “Put your ponies in the corral and
come right in. You’re just in time for dinner. I guess
I’ve got enough, if I haven’t, I can mighty soon get it.
I’m——”</p>

<p>Believing that the woman’s volubility would soon wear
itself out, Bowser had waited for her to pause of her
own accord. But when, after extending her hearty invitation
for the riders to come in and eat, she started on
a fresh tack, the ranchman decided to interrupt.</p>

<p>“Isn’t Hen home?” he asked, the failure of the man
to appear suggesting the far from welcome idea.</p>

<p>“No. He and the boys have been gone three days
driving in the cattle for shipping. I expect him back
this afternoon, though. He said it wouldn’t be more
than three days at the longest.” Then, noting the look of
disappointment that her words brought to her neighbor’s
face, she asked hastily: “There isn’t anything wrong,
is there? Nothing’s happened to Sarah?”</p>

<p>“Sarah’s all right; at least, she was when we left at
daybreak. But some ornery cowlifters got into my home
corral last night and made off with fifty head.” And
briefly he told Mrs. Hawks the uncanny circumstances of
the raid.</p>

<p>With eyes growing bigger at each word, the good
woman listened to the account of the mysterious spectre.</p>

<p>“Sakes alive! and you’ve left Sarah alone with that
thing liable to drop in on her any minute?” she exclaimed,
in consternation. “If I were she, I wouldn’t stay there
by myself a minute. No, sir, not a single minute. It isn’t
fair of you to make her, Sam. I’d just like to see Henry
Hawks leave me alone under such conditions.”</p>

<p>This vigorous scolding for failure to afford protection
to his wife shamed the owner of the Double Cross, and
hot flushes glowed beneath his weather-tanned face as he
strove to excuse himself.</p>

<p>“That’s just what I came over here for,” he stammered.
“I wanted Hen to let me have a couple of his
boys so’s I could use mine to trail the raiders.”</p>

<p>“It makes no difference what you intended to do,” declared
Mrs. Hawks. “You men are all alike. You seem
to think that we women can take care of ourselves, no
matter what happens. And, as though it weren’t enough
to make us live way out in the plains, you go and leave
us whenever you feel like it. If I were Sarah, I’d let
you know what I thought of such treatment, especially
with a spook hanging about.”</p>

<p>“Well, thank goodness, you’re not Sarah,” muttered
Bowser under his breath, though aloud he said: “To tell
the truth, Amy, I was so riled up over being tricked the
way I was that the only thing I thought of was getting on
the lifters’ trail. But, after what you’ve said, I see it
wasn’t just right toward Sarah.</p>

<p>“Pinky, cut out one of Hen’s ponies from the corral
and ride back to the ranch just as fast as you can travel.
Remember, I shall ask how long it took you when I get
home,” he added, noting the look of disappointment and
anger that spread over his cowboy’s face at the instructions.</p>

<p>But Pinky knew that orders were orders, especially
when delivered by the owner of the Double Cross ranch,
and, without any ado, wheeled his pony, rode over to the
corral, picked out one of the Star and Moon bronchos and
without as much as a glance toward his grinning bunkmates,
dashed from the yard.</p>

<p>Yet, to himself, the cowboy was telling in no uncertain
words or polite language what he thought of “meddling
old women.” And, so many were his ideas upon the subject,
that he was still intent upon expressing his opinion
when he reined into the yard of the Double Cross, some
three hours later.</p>

<p class="ph3">THE MYSTERIOUS SPECTRE REAPPEARS.</p>


<p>Even the delicious dinner Mrs. Hawks set before her
neighbor did not reconcile him to the unexpected delay
caused in his plans by the absence of the owner of the Star
and Moon. Moreover, he realized that there was reason
for the sharp reprimand he had received on account of his
lack of thought for the safety of his wife—and this realization
did not tend to mollify his ill-humor.</p>

<p>Noting this and fearing that she had, perhaps, said too
much, Mrs. Hawks sought to make amends.</p>

<p>“You mustn’t take what I said about leaving Sarah
too hard, Sam,” she exclaimed, contritely. “But, being
left alone on the ranch is my sore point, and I’m so accustomed
to taking Hen to task for it, that I don’t always
stop to think what I’m saying. Of course, I know you
were all cut up about your cattle—which is no more
than natural—and I reckon Sarah has been alone so often
she won’t mind, especially as it’s the daytime. If it was
night, now, it would be different.”</p>

<p>“It certainly would be,” returned Bowser, with emphasis.
“I had no idea of leaving Sarah alone. I told
you that. It’s Hen’s being away that upset my calculations.
What time did you say you expected him back?”</p>

<p>“During the afternoon. That is, to-day is the third
day he’s been gone and he said it wouldn’t take longer
than three days to round up the cattle, they’re on the
near range, you know, and drive them in.” And then,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
woman like, she began to borrow trouble, adding: “You
don’t suppose that spook could have made any trouble
for him, do you?”</p>

<p>“It certainly could have if it tried the same tricks on
Hen’s herd it did on mine,” responded the owner of the
Double Cross. “But, don’t start in imagining things,
Amy. A man gets trouble enough on a ranch without
worrying and fretting about what may or might happen.”</p>

<p>“That’s just what Hen says,” rejoined Mrs. Hawks.
“It’s easy enough for you men folks to live up to that.
You have so many things to keep you busy, you don’t have
the time to think. But with us women, it’s different.
Having nobody but you to take up our minds, we just
can’t help being afraid something may happen to you. I
know it’s that way with me about Hen, and I guess it
is with Sarah about you.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I suppose it is,” assented her neighbor. “But
just remember, worry doesn’t do anybody any good—and
generally makes you nervous and cross.” And with this
parting shot, the owner of the Double Cross, having finished
his dinner, arose and went out doors, followed by
his cowboys.</p>

<p>“Man, dear! but ain’t she the old spitfire!” chuckled
Deadshot, as they gained the yard, taking care, however,
to make sure that the woman was not within earshot
when he spoke. “I never did have any use for Hen
Hawks; but after seeing—and listening to—his running
mate, I certainly am sorry for him.”</p>

<p>“Well, he probably wouldn’t thank you for telling him
so,” smiled Bowser, his ill-humor disappearing under
the combined effect of the good dinner, his pipe and the
cowboy’s comment upon the garrulity of Mrs. Hawks.</p>

<p>Further pursuit of the topic was prevented, however,
by Sandy.</p>

<p>“Don’t it beat all how everything seems to go against
us in trailing them cattlelifters?” he asked. “First, we
couldn’t pick up their track. Then we couldn’t overhaul
’em, and now we’ve got to lose more time waiting for reinforcements
before starting out again. It sure does look
as though we were in for trouble all along the line.”</p>

<p>“So you’re beginning to wake up, are you?” chuckled
Deadshot. “Didn’t I say last night, when we came near
going loco over that ghostie, that whenever one of ’em
appeared, it meant trouble? And didn’t I tell you, after
we found it was a raid, that we’d have no easy time running
’em down, as Sam said he was agoing to do?”</p>

<p>The scornful tone in which the cowboy reminded his
bunkmate of his prophecies aroused Sandy’s ire.</p>

<p>“Sure you did. But you say so many things that
ain’t no account, a feller sort of has to see for himself
before he can agree with you.”</p>

<p>“That’s a hot one, Deadshot,” grinned his boss. “It’s
a good thing for you Pinky isn’t here, or between Sandy
and him, they’d have your goat before sundown.”</p>

<p>In a silence that was portentous in its intensity, the
cowboy took out his corn husk cigarette papers and
makings, deftly rolled one, lighted it, and, taking a long
draw, blew out the smoke deliberately, while his companions
wondered along what lines his retort would be.</p>

<p>“Did you ever notice, Sam?” he finally drawled, “that
there’s some folks has to be hit with a thing before they
can see it? That’s the case with Sandy, here, though, as
a member of the Double Cross outfit, I hate to be obliged
to admit it. Instead of realizing when a feller is clever
enough to pull off that ghostie stunt to cover a raid
there’d be trouble in getting close enough to ’em to pump
’em full of lead, he don’t tumble to it till about eighteen
hours afterwards.”</p>

<p>Fortunately, the foreman of the Double Cross had a
highly developed sense of humor, and he laughed at the
pat rejoinder as heartily as either Bowser or the man
who uttered it—with the result that what might have
turned into a serious quarrel between the two cowpunchers
and endangered the harmony of the avengers,
and the united action necessary to catch the raiders was
avoided.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Hawks had finished her housework, she
appeared on the veranda with a basket of sewing and
called to the men to join her. But, upon the pretext that
they were obliged to keep close watch of one of their
ponies in the fear it had strained a tendon, they managed
to avoid the tiresome company of the well-intentioned
but garrulous woman.</p>

<p>Now perched on the top rail of the corral, now
stretched upon the ground, the three men who were so
eager to be on their way in pursuit of the raiders whiled
away the time, ever and again searching the horizon to
the East for a glimpse of the Star and Moon outfit, with
what patience they could muster.</p>

<p>But as the afternoon wore away without either sight or
sound of them, Bowser began to grow restless.</p>

<p>“If those devils find we haven’t reached the swamps by
sundown, they are just as likely as not to drive my cattle
to some other place—and then we surely will have a
merry time locating them. It’ll be hard enough if we
know they are in the bottoms. But when we can’t be
certain even of that, we’ll have the very old Nick of a
time,” he complained.</p>

<p>“What do you want to do, start out and leave word for
Hen and his men to follow?” asked Sandy. “It does
seem too bad to give the ornery cusses a chance to get
away on us.”</p>

<p>“That’s the idea I was figuring on,” returned the ranchman.
“What do you say, Deadshot?”</p>

<p>“Just what you told Mrs. Hawks—don’t borrow
trouble,” rejoined the cowboy, a twinkle in his eye.</p>

<p>“Meaning?”</p>

<p>“That it’s a fool idea to worry about the lifters hiking
out right away when once they’ve hit the safety of the
swamps. Let me tell you, they will be only too thankful
to find we’re not on their trail so they can get a good
night’s rest. You two know, as well as I do, it ain’t any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
cinch job shoving fifty head of cattle along as fast as
they can leg it in the dark.”</p>

<p>“There’s good sense in that reasoning,” declared the
owner of the stolen steers, after several moments’ reflection.</p>

<p>“And the beauty of it is, it’s the facts,” exclaimed
Deadshot. “I never knew a cowlifter who wasn’t lazy
and, once in the bottoms, they’ll feel so safe, I’m willing
to bet they won’t think of breaking cover for a week,
at least, unless we jump ’em. So if Hen don’t show up
for forty-eight hours more, there won’t be any great
harm done.”</p>

<p>The avengers were not obliged to wait so long for the
appearance of the men they hoped to get to take up the
trail with them, however.</p>

<p>Just as twilight tinted the waving grasses with glorious
reds and purples, the halloo of the cowboys rang out, and
in due course the owner of the Star and Moon ranch rode
into the yard.</p>

<p>At the sight of his neighbor, he was glad, greeting him
with hearty cordiality and chiding him for the length of
time it had been since he had paid him a visit. But when
he learned the purpose of Bowser’s presence, he became
grave.</p>

<p>“You’re sure right, I’ll help you trail the skulks,
Sam!” he declared. “Just as soon as the boys have had
their chuck, we’ll start. We drove down by easy stages,
that’s what took us so long, so they aren’t tired.”</p>

<p>While the two ranchmen had been exchanging greetings
and talking, the rest of the outfit had come up with
the cattle, and, as he observed this, Hawks called out:</p>

<p>“Hey, Dude, tell Ki Yi to come right up to the house.”</p>

<p>But, before he entered the presence of his boss, the man
whose name had been bestowed upon him by his bunkmates
because of the yell he always emitted when excited,
as well as the other members of the Star and Moon outfit,
had been made aware of the reason for the presence of
the men from the Double Cross.</p>

<p>“I suppose Deadshot has told you about the raid?”
smiled Hawks, as his cowboy came up to the veranda.</p>

<p>“Sure.”</p>

<p>“What do you make of it? Ever hear of that ghost
stunt being pulled off before?”</p>

<p>“That’s a new one on me, for certain, Hen. It strikes
me, they’re a mighty smart lot of lifters, and it’s dollars
to a coyote flea the whole bunch are in the swamps this
very minute.”</p>

<p>“Think they’ll shift to another hiding place?” asked
Bowser.</p>

<p>“Not till they’ve got some of the beef back on the
steers they run off of ’em—unless we jump ’em,” declared
the cowpuncher.</p>

<p>“Then I reckon with Ki Yi and Deadshot agreed on
that, we needn’t break our necks riding across the plains
to-night, Sam,” exclaimed the owner of the Star and
Moon.</p>

<p>“Daybreak will be time enough to start,” assented
Bowser, and instructions to that effect were accordingly
sent to the men he proposed to take from the ranch by
Hawks.</p>

<p>But in their assertion that the Midnight Raider would
not leave the swamps for many a day unless forced out,
both Deadshot and Ki Yi were mistaken!</p>

<p>Had the avengers been on guard at the bottoms just at
dusk, they would have seen a lone horseman emerge from
the tall grass, scan the surrounding plains searchingly and
then set out at an easy lope toward the very spot where
the scenes of the night before were being described for
the twentieth time.</p>

<p>And had they been on watch at the sheds of the Star
and Moon horse corral at midnight, they would have
discovered that same horseman dismount in its shadow!</p>

<p>But, instead, the cowboys and their bosses were sleeping
soundly.</p>

<p>After listening intently for several minutes, the skulking
figure hastily gathered a bunch of dried grass, thrust
a lighted match into the waving ends and then placed the
flaming mass under an edge of the corral shed.</p>

<p>Twice he repeated the action, then rushed toward the
home house and applied the torch in five places.</p>

<p>Pausing only long enough by the ranch house to make
sure the fire had caught, the miscreant ran back to his
horse, vaulted lightly onto its back, rode a short distance
into the cover afforded by the shadows from the bunkhouse
and then drew rein to gloat in his fiendish handiwork.</p>

<p>Inflammable as tinder because of their dryness, the
boards blazed fiercely, and soon both the horse shed and
the house were roaring cauldrons of seething flames.</p>

<p>As the conflagration gained headway, its crackling and
onrush roused Bowser.</p>

<p>Springing to window, he caught sight of the leaping
flames.</p>

<p>“Fire! Fire!” he yelled at the top of his lungs.</p>

<p>Awakened by the startling cry, Mr. and Mrs. Hawks
jumped from their bed, while the cowboys tumbled out
of their bunks.</p>

<p>With such awful rapidity did the flames devour the
wooden buildings that little beyond the clothes by their
bedsides were the inmates of the house able to save.</p>

<p>In a momentary lull, as they watched the flames, there
rang out shrill and piercing:</p>

<p>“O-u-e-e!”</p>

<p>For a moment, Bowser gazed at his men, astounded.</p>

<p>“Get your guns! It’s the Midnight Raiders!” he
yelled.</p>

<p>Instantly the boys from the Double Cross and those
of the Star and Moon dashed into the bunkhouse, returning
immediately with rifles and six shooters.</p>

<p>“Shoot and shoot to kill!” thundered Bowser.</p>

<p>But, ignorant of which direction to rake with their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
shells, the cowpunchers stood in a bunch, straining their
ears for a repetition of the cry.</p>

<p>As they waited, the roof tree of the corral fell in, sending
a shower of sparks high into the air.</p>

<p><i>And, while the lurid flare lighted the surrounding country,
of a sudden, a white spectre dashed out onto the
plains.</i></p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3">THE RUNNING NIGHT FIGHT.</p>


<p>An instant, the ranchmen and cowboys stood, too dumbfounded
to move.</p>

<p>Then the shriek of a mocking jeer galvanized them into
action.</p>

<p>Bang! Bang! Bang! went their guns, the deeper explosions
of the rifles and the staccato barks of the six
shooters sounding above the roar of the flames.</p>

<p>But, as though shielded by a magic armour, the spectre
raced on, unscathed by the rain of bullets.</p>

<p>“To the corral!”</p>

<p>“They’re after the cattle!”</p>

<p>“Get horses and after ’em!”</p>

<p>In shrill confusion, the shouts of advice and command
were uttered by cowboys and foremen.</p>

<p>But loud above them all rang Bowser’s roar:</p>

<p>“Deadshot, get your man!”</p>

<p>Striving with might and main to live up to his nickname,
the cowboy from the Double Cross ranch rushed
on foot after the fleeing spectre, pumping lead at it as fast
as he could throw shells into his repeating rifle.</p>

<p>The combination of effort to “make good” and the
uneven footing, however, proved too much for the cowboy,
and when his magazine was empty, the lone horseman
was still riding away.</p>

<p>Realizing that were they to overtake the man, they
must take up the pursuit without delay, the ranch owners
shouted at the rest of their men to mount and give chase.</p>

<p>“Remember, a thousand dollars to the fellow who
drops the fiend!” shouted Bowser.</p>

<p>“And I’ll give the same!” yelled the owner of the
burned ranch houses.</p>

<p>The thought of being burned out of house and home by
the very miscreant of whom they were planning to go in
pursuit was sufficient incentive to make the cowpunchers
eager to inflict vengeance on the men who had so defied
them.</p>

<p>But the announcement of the two thousand dollars reward
turned this eagerness into frantic endeavor.</p>

<p>Yelling and shouting to one another, the cowboys raced
hither and thither, trying to catch their ponies which had
dashed terror-stricken from the burning corral.</p>

<p>“Hadn’t we better send some of the men to the cattle
yard, to prevent the raiders lifting any of the critturs?”
asked Sandy, coming close to his master.</p>

<p>The corral into which Hawks’ boys had driven the
steers was so situated, however, that the light from the
flames enabled the men to see three sides of the barbed-wire
fence, while back of the fourth, the flare lighted
the plains.</p>

<p>And as they strained their eyes, no human form could
they see except the white spectre.</p>

<p>“Man, dear! he’s stopped and is watching his work!”
cried Deadshot.</p>

<p>Instantly the eyes of the ranchmen and several of the
cowboys, who were near enough to hear the words, followed
the direction of their companion’s pointing finger.</p>

<p>There, as calm as though he were watching some cowpuncher
frolic, sat the white figure upon his horse.</p>

<p>“Skulls and crossbones! don’t you suppose there are
any more of the raiders?” queried Sandy, suddenly.</p>

<p>“Reckon that’s all,” grunted Ki Yi. “If there had
been more of ’em, we would have been told by a few
bullets.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” retorted Bowser. “You don’t mean to
tell me that one lone horseman could bedevil my men and
me, cut my fences, stampede my cattle and get away with
fifty of ’em, do you? Man, you’re crazy!”</p>

<p>“I ain’t saying there warn’t more than one in the raid
on the Double Cross,” returned Ki Yi. “What I said
was there’s only one mixed up in this here night’s business.”</p>

<p>“Then, by thunder! get busy, you dubs, and corral
him!” roared the owner of the Star and Moon. “The
idea of one man being able to burn my buildings and get
away when I’ve four men of my own and Bowser has
two right on the spot!”</p>

<p>Stung by the scorn and disgust in the ranchman’s tones,
Ki Yi, Dude and Deadshot were moving away to take
some of the ponies the other members of the Star and
Moon outfit had managed to catch when they were halted
by Sandy’s words.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t be too quick to break away, Hen,” he
cautioned. “Your steers may be quiet enough now—the
only fussing they’re doing is what is naturally to be expected
with the fire flaring in their eyes—but I don’t
doubt for a minute, there are five or six raiders in amongst
’em, ready to cut loose and stampede the critturs the
minute they see us riding away. That’s probably part of
their scheme—they’re counting on our giving chase to
that ghostie. That’s probably why he’s sitting out there,
so all-fired cool. It don’t stand to reason that a lone
man would take such chances against eight when he could
be hiking across the plains, putting distance between us
and him while we’re making up our minds what to do.”</p>

<p>The obvious soundness of the foreman’s argument gave
it instant attention from the ranch owners.</p>

<p>In the first place, it tended to lessen the odium of their
having been thrown into a panic—in addition to being
made to suffer very appreciable losses—by one man. And
though their eyes showed them only a single raider, they
were only too willing to believe that more of them were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
hidden among the cattle, merely awaiting a propitious
moment to make their presence known.</p>

<p>Accordingly, they accepted more readily the suggestion
of Sandy than was warranted in view of the fact that
both Deadshot and Ki Yi believed the Midnight Raider
was the lone horseman, spectral in appearance, that
mocked them so tauntingly by remaining in plain sight of
the destruction he had wrought.</p>

<p>“That’s more like the truth, Hen,” asserted the owner
of the Double Cross, after he had deliberated over his
foreman’s words a few moments. “Ki Yi and Deadshot
always were excitable boys. It’s a good thing Sandy has
a little common sense and the courage to express it, or
we’d have been stampeded by the two of ’em into chasing
that howling devil—and giving the rest of the gang the
chance to carry off your cattle at their pleasure.”</p>

<p>“Righto!” returned Hawks. “There’s nothing pays
more than making haste slowly.</p>

<p>“Hey, you fellows, bring horses for Sam and me and
then we’ll ride over to the corral and inspect the fences.”</p>

<p>“Then you don’t care about getting that spook?” inquired
Deadshot. “Last night, you remember, Sam, you
was all for chasing the lifters, notwithstanding the fact
you didn’t have the slightest idea in which direction they
had ridden, and letting the cattle go. <i>Now</i>, when you
have the biggest sort of a chance to run down the cuss,
you are all for patrolling the corral.</p>

<p>“If <i>I</i> was running this business, and a man had driven
off a bunch of my steers, and then set the buildings, belonging
to the man I was getting to join the trail with
me, afire, and I saw the man who turned the tricks
a-watching what I was going to do, I’d want to pump his
good-for-nothing carcass so full of lead it wouldn’t stay
on his horse. That would make sure of at least <i>one</i>
of ’em—and I’m inclined to agree with Ki Yi that when
we get that one, we’ve got the gang.”</p>

<p>“You’re the great little talker, Deadshot; the only
trouble is you talk too much. A person can’t tell when
you’re saying things just for the sake of hearing yourself
saying them, or whether you’re talking facts,” retorted
the owner of the Double Cross.</p>

<p>“It’s my judgment there are more of the devils in
amongst the cattle, and for that reason, I’m for inspecting
the corral fence. By being on the spot, we’ll be able to
get the whole crowd instead of only one—like we would
if we set sail after that fiend out yonder.”</p>

<p>“To the corral it is,” exclaimed Hawks. “So let’s
get over there and not stand arguing here. First thing
we know, they’ll rush out and we’ll lose the whole kit and
boodle, as Sam says.”</p>

<p>“Which we’ll do anyhow!” growled Ki Yi to Deadshot.</p>

<p>But the cowboys were too wise to press the argument
any harder and, declaring one to another that the blame
would not be on their shoulders, they cantered over to
the corral.</p>

<p>Bitterly, indeed, were the ranch owners to rue their
decision!</p>

<p>“How long do you intend to patrol the fences?” asked
Dude, as the eight men drew close to the corral.</p>

<p>“If we find the barbed wire is cut, till the devils show
themselves,” returned the owner of the Star and Moon,
“even if we have to stay here all night.”</p>

<p>“According to that, if the fences aren’t cut, do you
mean you will believe the raiders aren’t inside?” sneered
Deadshot.</p>

<p>The tone of the cowboy angered Bowser and Hawks,
and the former was not slow in letting him know it.</p>

<p>“Don’t try to get smart, Deadshot,” he snapped. “You
know as well as I do—or you ought to know—that the
reason we aren’t accepting your advice is because we can’t
trust you.</p>

<p>“Of course, if we find the fences haven’t been tampered
with, we’ll turn our attention to the spectral rider.
So be lively and inspect the cor——”</p>

<p>“Well, you’ll be too late to round up <i>that</i> chap to-night,”
retorted Deadshot, grimly.</p>

<p>“Why?” demanded both the ranchmen.</p>

<p>“Because he’s disappeared!”</p>

<p>In amazement, the men turned in the direction in which
they had seen the lone horseman calmly sitting his pony.</p>

<p>Not a sign of him was visible!</p>

<p>“But he was there a few minutes ago!” gasped several
of the cowpunchers.</p>

<p>“So was Hen’s house,” grunted Deadshot.</p>

<p>“Watch out for the fences!” cried Sandy. “His
going is probably the signal for the dash from the corral!”</p>

<p>With spur and quirt, the cowboys raced around the
enclosure which, fortunately for them, was still illumined
by the flares from the ruins of the ranch house, while
Bowser and Hawks waited near the gate in silence.</p>

<p>“Nothing wrong with the wires on the East;” reported
Sandy, the first of the cowpunchers to complete his tour
of inspection.</p>

<p>Comment by the ranchmen was prevented by the quick
succession in which the rest of their boys rode in, announcing
that on the other sides of the big yard the
fences were intact.</p>

<p>“Tricked!” grunted Ki Yi. “That Midnight Raider
is sure one nervy crittur!”</p>

<p>“That’s the ticket—but he hasn’t got anything on me!”
retorted Deadshot. “Sam, I suppose you don’t mind if I
hit his trail <i>now</i>, do you?”</p>

<p>“Go as far as you like—only get the devil!” returned
his master.</p>

<p>“Then come on, Ki Yi! We’ve no time to lose!”
shouted the man from the Double Cross.</p>

<p>And, without giving either of the ranch owners the
chance to proffer any advice, even had they been so inclined,
which they were not on account of the fiasco of the
inspection, the two cowpunchers dashed out onto the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
plains in the direction where they had last seen the lone
horseman.</p>

<p>“He’s worked the same vanishing act he did at the
Double Cross!” declared Deadshot, as he raced along
beside his companion. “So don’t expect to see something
white suddenly bob up.”</p>

<p>Quickly the two men, whose opinions had been disregarded,
got beyond the line where the reflection of the
fire illumined the plains for them.</p>

<p>But, though they could not distinguish objects ahead
of them readily, their bodies were distinctly outlined
against the background of flames—as they were soon to
learn to their sorrow!</p>

<p>Scarce another hundred yards had they ridden, than
Bang! went a rifle to the West of them and an instant
later, Ki Yi’s horse gave a snort of pain and plunged
forward, all but throwing his rider over his head.</p>

<p>With a string of shocking oaths, the cowboy disentangled
himself from his stirrups and began to pump his
rifle in the direction whence the shell had come.</p>

<p>“Get to him, man! Get to him!” he shouted at Deadshot.
“Your pony is fresh and you can soon overhaul
him. I’ll let you get his direction by drawing his fire. It’s
a cinch he can’t blaze away at both of us at the same time—when
we are in different places.”</p>

<p>The last words of the dismounted member of the Star
and Moon outfit were lost upon Deadshot, however.</p>

<p>No sooner had he seen the fate that had overtaken his
comrade than he had dashed away.</p>

<p>“You may have given me the slip once, you ornery crittur,
but you can’t get away from Deadshot Pete twice
running!” he hissed.</p>

<p>Yet the bragging cowpuncher was almost forced to
eat his words!</p>

<p>True to his promise, Ki Yi was doing his best to hold
the attention of the lone horseman by sending bullet after
bullet in his direction.</p>

<p>But the Midnight Raider was clever, and, safe in the
cover of the darkness, he stopped firing to discover what
had become of his other pursuer.</p>

<p>As he beheld him leaping his horse over the waving
grass, he grinned.</p>

<p>“The surest way to stop him is to drop his horse, too,”
he muttered to himself. And, taking careful aim, he
waited until Deadshot was within less than two hundred
yards of him, then fired.</p>

<p>But his second shot was not so lucky as his first.</p>

<p>Instead of tumbling the pony over, the shell sailed
harmlessly over the cowpuncher’s head.</p>

<p>“So that’s where you are, eh?” snapped Deadshot, as
he gauged the direction of the raider. “That’s all I
wanted to know.”</p>

<p>And, as he uttered the words, he threw his rifle to
his shoulder and pulled the trigger.</p>

<p>Realizing that he had failed of his purpose, the lone
horseman was too shrewd to linger, and, whirling his
pony, headed for his hiding place, with the Double Cross
cowboy in hot pursuit.</p>

</div>

<p class="ph3">BOWSER DISCIPLINES HIS FOREMAN.</p>


<p>At the first crack of the rifles, Bowser and Hawks
had dashed after their two cowpunchers with the other
members of their outfits at their heels.</p>

<p>“Get him! Get him!” shouted the former.</p>

<p>“Don’t go too far!” cautioned Sandy. “This may be
the very trick to get us out of the way, so the raiders can
dash from the corral.”</p>

<p>“But there are no raiders in there, you fool!” retorted
Hawks. “Keep your mouth shut, and see if you can’t do
something!”</p>

<p>Sweet, indeed, were these words to the other cowpunchers,
who had been prevented from adopting the
ideas of Deadshot and Ki Yi and running down the
raider, when they could see him by the foreman’s overdeveloped
sense of caution. But, beyond chuckling to
themselves, they gave no outward sign of their pleasure.</p>

<p>Leaning far over their ponies’ necks, the men rode,
searching out the plains in their effort to locate either
their pals or the lone horseman. For they realized that
unless they exerted the greatest care, they might, in
their excitement, mistake their friends for the raider.</p>

<p>Mindful of this danger, and determined not to allow
any more untoward incidents to mark the pursuit of the
man who had tricked him and lifted his cattle, Bowser
shouted:</p>

<p>“Nobody fire till after we’ve picked up Deadshot and
Ki Yi. It would be just our luck to hit one of them instead
of the cow thief.”</p>

<p>And this warning was uttered just in time!</p>

<p>Riding a little to the right and in advance of the others,
Sandy suddenly caught sight of his bunkmate, as he stood
over the prostrate form of his pony, emptying his rifle
in the direction whence the shot from the lone horseman
had come.</p>

<p>“This way! This way! I’ve found him!” yelled the
excited foreman of the Double Cross, turning in his saddle
and beckoning to his fellows.</p>

<p>“Then drop him!”</p>

<p>“Don’t give him the chance to make another getaway!”</p>

<p>Loud and clear, these commands rang out, while Bowser
and Hawks raced their ponies toward where Sandy
was pointing.</p>

<p>Luckily for the cowpuncher, however, he had been
close enough to the foreman when the latter discovered
him to hear his hail to his fellows and also their answers.</p>

<p>And he realized if he were to save his life, there was no
time to be lost!</p>

<p>“Don’t shoot! It’s I, Ki Yi! My horse was shot
from under me!” he shouted at the top of his lungs, at
the same time, however, taking the extra precaution<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
to drop flat behind the body of his pony that it might
protect him from the shell of some excited pursuer who
had pulled the trigger of his rifle before clearly understanding
the warning.</p>

<p>His words had been in time to prevent such a misfortune,
however, and quickly his comrades were beside
him.</p>

<p>“Are you hurt?” inquired his master.</p>

<p>“Only my pride. To think a measly cowlifter could
knock the horse from under me and me not even able
to see him to hit him!”</p>

<p>Sharing the humiliation which the Midnight Raider
was bringing upon the outfits, of the Double Cross and
the Star and Moon ranches, the boys strained their eyes
to penetrate the darkness enveloping the plains.</p>

<p>“Oh, you needn’t try to locate him. He’s miles away
by this time,” sneered Ki Yi. “<i>He</i> don’t sit round sucking
his thumbs when it’s time for action. Somebody give
me a pony, will you?”</p>

<p>But none of the cowpunchers were willing to surrender
their mounts to their unhorsed companion.</p>

<p>Suddenly, Bowser noted the absence of his man.</p>

<p>“Where’s Deadshot?” he queried, anxiously.</p>

<p>“Chasing the raider,” returned Ki Yi.</p>

<p>“Did you see him?” demanded Dude, breathlessly.</p>

<p>“Sure. He came right up and said ‘Pardon, me gentlemen,
I believe you are looking for me. I’m going to
ride to the right,’” mocked his outfit mate.</p>

<p>“Now, don’t get sore,” returned the other. “I only
wanted to know if you were sure Deadshot was on the
real trail or whether we’d have to take chances on finding
it.”</p>

<p>“That’s about what it is, kiddo,” rejoined Ki Yi. “All
Deadshot or I could get was the general direction. But
Deadshot’s no fool and he won’t travel many miles without
learning if he’s on the proper course. It’s so I can
be on hand to help him, I want another pony without
going back to the ranch house. Besides, since the fire
scattered them, it may take a couple of hours to get one
that’s worth riding.”</p>

<p>It had been his master’s intention to order his man
curtly to return and cut out his own mount. But the last
words changed his mind. Well was he aware that Ki Yi
was far and away the nerviest rider and best trail-finder
in his outfit. As there was a natural rivalry between the
boys of the Star and Moon and those of the Double
Cross, Hawks did not wish to handicap his success by
depriving himself of the assistance of his best man.</p>

<p>Ere he could make up his mind which boy to send back,
however, the difficulty was solved for him.</p>

<p>“You can’t leave Amy alone,” exclaimed Bowser,
mindful of the upbraiding he had received at dinner for
not providing protection for his own wife. “Now there’s
no one more fitted to care for women and cattle that I
know of than Sandy. He’s what you might call overcautious.
If you like, I’ll send him back to help Amy and
to quiet her, and Ki Yi can take his pony.”</p>

<p>It was with amazement that the other cowboys listened
to these words from the owner of the Double Cross, and
so bitter was the tone in which they were uttered that
none of them had the inclination, even, to laugh at their
luckless comrade to whom they were addressed.</p>

<p>Partially because he was afraid his neighbor would
repent his generosity and partially for the reason he was
sorry for the berated foreman—knowing as he and all
the others did that Sandy’s advice had been given only
for the purpose of avoiding a repetition of the raider’s
tactics of the night before—Hawks quickly accepted the
offer.</p>

<p>In silence the transfer was made, the foreman feeling
too crestfallen to utter any protest.</p>

<p>But his spirits were revived somewhat by the very
man to whom he was surrendering his pony.</p>

<p>“When it comes daylight, catch a couple of ponies and
make the missus ride over to the Double Cross with you.
She’s dead set against being left alone, and, after what’s
happened to-night, she’ll be all the more ready to go.
Tell her the cattle will get along all right. If she bucks
at that, ask her if she isn’t of more importance than a
bunch of steers—and she’ll go fast enough. Then, when
you’ve put the two women together, get Pinky and ride
for all you are worth for the swamps.”</p>

<p>“But the women won’t let us go, perhaps,” objected
Sandy.</p>

<p>“Tell ’em it’s orders from the old man.”</p>

<p>“That won’t be the truth.”</p>

<p>“Never mind. I’ll guarantee he won’t offer any complaint
when you two ride up to where we’re camping.”</p>

<p>“Then you think we won’t be too late if we don’t join
you till to-morrow afternoon?”</p>

<p>“No—nor if you didn’t get to us for a couple of days.
If we drive that slick cuss out of the bottoms inside of a
week, we’ll be all-fired lucky.”</p>

<p>A moment the foreman hesitated, then reached out his
hand and shook Ki Yi’s gratefully.</p>

<p>“All right, I’ll do it. Much obliged. I won’t forget
this night.”</p>

<p>And, without saying another word or asking for any
instructions from the ranch owners, Sandy set out to return
to the ruins and Mrs. Hawks at a rapid lope.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3">A THRILLING RESCUE.</p>


<p>No sooner had he given his suggestion to Sandy than
Ki Yi buried the rowels of his spurs in the pony’s flanks
and darted after Deadshot.</p>

<p>“Hey, you numbskull, where you going?” shouted the
owner of the Double Cross ranch, angrily. “I didn’t
give you a mount just to have you go off by yourself.
Wait for the rest of us. We’ve got to decide which is
the direction to take.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span></p>

<p>“Haven’t got time,” retorted the cowboy, exasperatingly.
“There’s been too much talk already. I know
which way Deadshot went, and he’s on the raider’s trail.”</p>

<p>“Then we’ll follow you,” called the owner of the Star
and Moon. And quickly the troop of horsemen leaped
their ponies in the wake of Ki Yi.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Deadshot and the lone horseman he
was pursuing were dashing over the plains.</p>

<p>Whether he was following his quarry or not, the cowboy
from the Double Cross ranch did not know. He had
hoped that the raider would continue the running fight
with which the chase had opened, thereby enabling him to
gauge correctly the exact course the man he was pursuing
was taking.</p>

<p>But the fiend who had stolen Bowser’s cattle and
burned Hawks’ buildings was far too clever to give his
whereabouts away in any such manner.</p>

<p>From the fact that the cowboys had exchanged shots
with him—and had come off second best—he realized that
the search for him would be unrelenting. In consequence,
he was determined they should not know exactly in what
direction he was headed. That they would trail the
Double Cross steers to the Sangammon swamps, he did
not doubt. Yet he believed that, could he enter the bottoms
without being seen in the act, he would be able to
elude his pursuers and eventually drive out the cattle and
sell them.</p>

<p>He forgot, however, that the cause of wrongdoers
never enjoys ultimate success.</p>

<p>Consequently, he thought only of his purpose to throw
the cowboy off his track.</p>

<p>With that end in view, he rode low over his horse,
dropping to one side or the other, Indian fashion, when a
rise in the plains might expose his form to the eyes he
knew were strained for a glimpse of him, at the same
time swerving his course to the North that he might
cross the trail made by the steers he had lifted and swing
into the swamp from a direction almost opposite that
where his pursuers would expect.</p>

<p>Thus deprived of any guidance as to the position of
his quarry, Deadshot was forced to rely on his powers
of deduction.</p>

<p>That the stolen cattle had been driven to the swamp
he knew. And he was also convinced that the man who
had burned Hawks’ buildings was the lifter who had
deceived the entire Double Cross outfit with his spectral
trick. With these two premises, it was not difficult for
him to reach the conclusion that the fugitive would seek
the shelter of the bottom lands. And accordingly he decided
to strike the shortest route to the Sangammon
swamps in the hope that he might outride the man he was
pursuing, because of the greater freshness of his own
mount, and arrive in time to intercept the raider.</p>

<p>Having evolved his method of procedure, therefore,
Deadshot settled down grimly to his long night ride.</p>

<p>But that his plan was to come to naught, the reader
already knows.</p>

<p>As they trailed in his wake, however, Ki Yi and the
other avengers were mystified by the lack of shooting.
To them, the silence seemed to indicate that some mishap
had overtaken the cowboy, and great was their anxiety
on that account.</p>

<p>Once or twice, Bowser suggested the advisability of
making a search for him, but each time he was overruled.</p>

<p>“If Deadshot did lose his pony, like Ki Yi, he would
know enough to go back to what’s left of my home
ranch,” finally declared Hawks. “And if he’d been
wounded, he would either have ridden for us or to the
ranch. So it’s all the same. It’s my opinion, though,
that he has set out to follow the fiend alone. You know
you gave him a pretty severe call down for not hitting
the man when he dashed from the shadow of the bunkhouse
out onto the plains.”</p>

<p>This mention of the spectral appearance presented by
the Midnight Raider turned their minds to the manner
in which he worked his trick.</p>

<p>Many were the suggestions advanced, but none were
correct.</p>

<p>That he was first white and then seemed to vanish from
sight, they all knew. Yet had they been close enough
to see how the trickster produced the uncanny effect, they
would have been surprised—and humiliated—by its simplicity.</p>

<p>The ghostly appearance was obtained from a peaked
hood which fitted over the fellow’s head and a long,
flowing robe, white on one side and black on the other.</p>

<p>By seizing the ends of the robe, with the white side out,
as he always wore it when starting on a raid, and waving
his arms, he could produce the eerie, floating effect. And
as his horse was a dark brown, by either riding slowly or
leaping and plunging, he could give suggestion of traveling
through the air, at will.</p>

<p>And his disappearing act was equally easy.</p>

<p>Whenever pursuit grew too close or he desired to inspire
additional terror vanishing and then appearing
again, he simply pulled the robe over his head, keeping
the black side out.</p>

<p>But in their ignorance of the truth, the cowboys taxed
their imaginations to the utmost, without any other satisfaction
than the whiling away of the weary hours they
swept through the waving grass until dawn enabled them
to scan the plains for a sight of either friend or foe.</p>

<p>Having ridden at a terrific pace, considering the handicap
afforded by the darkness and the tall grass, Deadshot
reached the edge of the swamps before daylight, and, to
his satisfaction, was able to conceal his pony in some
saplings and then climb into them, from which point
of vantage he hoped to discover the cowlifter sneaking
toward his hiding place.</p>

<p>With the gradual lightening of the plains, he was suddenly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
thrown into great excitement by the sight of a lone
horseman approaching the bottoms cautiously.</p>

<p>Clutching his rifle tightly, he drew a bead on the man.</p>

<p>But, fortunately for both, he did not pull the trigger.</p>

<p>What the reason was, Deadshot said later he could not
tell. But his failure so to do spared the life of Ki Yi—for
the approaching horseman was none other than the
man from the Star and Moon outfit who had made a desperate
attempt to catch up with his pal from the Double
Cross.</p>

<p>Trembling as he thought how near he can come to
shooting down his friend, Deadshot waited to see what
Ki Yi would do.</p>

<p>But the cowboy was a scout of no mean ability.</p>

<p>Rising in his stirrups from time to time as he drew
nearer and nearer to the edge of the swamp, he soon discovered
the trail through the dew-laden grass which his
pal had made.</p>

<p>And, as he did so, he, too, threw his rifle to his shoulder.
Then, realizing that any one hiding in the underbrush
surrounding the bottom lands would be able to
see him when he could not detect the person concealed, he
suddenly slid from his pony, hobbled it, and, crouching so
low that his back was not visible above the waving tops of
the grass, resumed his following of the trail.</p>

<p>Arrived at the saplings, however, it did not take him
long to discover and recognize Deadshot’s horse. But
where the cowboy was, he was unable to make out until
a chuckle caused him to look up into the branches directly
over his head.</p>

<p>“That’s one on me,” he exclaimed, in a low voice, shaking
his fist at his pal.</p>

<p>“No doubt of that. And it’s a mighty good thing it
was I in the tree instead of Mr. Cowlifter. I came mighty
near putting a bullet into you as it was when I first caught
sight of you,” he added, shuddering at the closeness of
the call.</p>

<p>“But you ought to have known it was I,” returned
Ki Yi.</p>

<p>“Don’t see why. I knew your pony had been shot under
you and I didn’t have any idea how soon you’d get
another.”</p>

<p>“That’s true enough. But you were chasing the
raider, not he you.”</p>

<p>“Which shows how little you know about it. Having a
fresher mount than he, after he stopped firing so that I
couldn’t get a line on him, I decided to outride him and
be here to greet him.”</p>

<p>“Well, did you?”</p>

<p>“More than I know. He hasn’t come yet—and he
won’t if you leave your broncho out there where any one
can see it.”</p>

<p>“I’ll bring him in, but I don’t believe we’ll get a shot
at the ornery cuss from this side of the swamp. He’s
either beaten you to it or he’s struck the bottoms from
some other direction.”</p>

<p>And, as the reader knows, this is just what the Midnight
Raider had done.</p>

<p>After making his pony fast close beside Deadshot’s,
Ki Yi climbed into a neighboring sapling, and together
they watched until about nine o’clock, when they agreed
their quarry had given them the slip, and they descended
to have a bite to eat.</p>

<p>This finished, they discussed whether or not they should
do some scouting on their own hook while waiting for the
rest of the outfits to come up, finally abandoning the idea
in the fear that the horsemen might not find their trails
and enter the swamp at some other point.</p>

<p>And well for the ranch owners was it that they did!</p>

<p>Having been unable to keep Ki Yi in sight, they had
headed for the Southern end of the swamps, while their
two cowboys had struck out for the middle. Consequently,
it was only because the latter were keeping a
lookout for their pals that they discovered them several
miles away, about the middle of the forenoon.</p>

<p>“Man, dear, but I’m glad to see you!” exclaimed Bowser,
as Deadshot and Ki Yi joined them. “Every man
jack of us has a different idea how we ought to go about
trailing the raider, and none of us know enough about the
business to track a buffalo. But, now you’re here, we’ll
turn the leadership over to you.”</p>

<p>This suggestion met with the approval of Hawks,
much to the delight of his men.</p>

<p>“That being the case, I reckon we’d best hit the trail
where the cattle was driven in,” declared Deadshot. “Ki
Yi and I’ve been watching since daybreak and nary a
sight of the crittur have we seen, nor we didn’t run across
any trail on our way here, and unless you-all did, it’s a
cinch the man we’re after didn’t enter the swamp to the
South or at the middle.”</p>

<p>“We didn’t see as much as a coyote track,” returned
the owner of the Star and Moon, “so the cattle trail it is.”</p>

<p>And without more ado, the avengers headed their
ponies Northward and entered the Sangammon bottom
lands at the precise spot where Bowser’s steers had,
some twenty-four hours previous.</p>

<p>Aware of the treacherous mudholes, Deadshot and
Ki Yi followed the cattle trail as best they could. But
the task was no simple one, for the reason that the softness
of the footing left no hoof marks and the grass had
had time to recover from its brushing aside or down, except
in instances where it had been trampled into the
mire.</p>

<p>So much noise did the ponies make, plunging and
splashing as they struggled to get out of the mud that
the two leaders soon realized that their coming would be
heard by any one in hiding in sufficient time to make a
getaway or establish an ambuscade, and accordingly they
called a halt to discuss what was best to do.</p>

<p>But, before they could begin the council of war, one
of their number came near death!</p>

<p>In his desire to ride alongside Deadshot, Bowser reined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
his pony out of the trail. But scarce a yard had he advanced
than the animal stepped into one of the dread
mudholes and began to sink with incredible rapidity.</p>

<p>“Help! Help! I’m being sucked under!” shouted the
terror-stricken man.</p>

<p>Understanding full well the danger that threatened
the owner of the Double Cross ranch, Deadshot and Ki
Yi ordered the others to halt and hold their ponies where
they were while they themselves dismounted and rushed
to the rescue.</p>

<p>“We’ll take him one on each side,” exclaimed Ki Yi,
as they drew near the wildly-struggling horse.</p>

<p>To the man sinking to such a horrible death and to
the others watching, it seemed as though the two cowboys
never would reach him.</p>

<p>Yet they were making haste with all speed possible.</p>

<p>Already Bowser’s stirrups had been gripped in the relentless
maw of the mudhole, and they realized that it
would require all of their strength to draw him from
the powerful and mysterious suction. Consequently, it
was of the utmost importance that they choose footing
that would not give way with them, thereby precipitating
them into the mudhole—and sending all three to their
death.</p>

<p>But the footing for the rescuers grew worse instead of
better.</p>

<p>“We can’t make it, this way!” cried Deadshot.</p>

<p>“Man, dear, you’re sure not going to desert me?”
pleaded the fast-disappearing ranchman.</p>

<p>“Not for a minute!” returned his cowboy. “Hey,
Hawks, and the rest of you! throw your lariats over
Sam’s shoulders.”</p>

<p>With a will, the men obeyed and for the next few seconds
the air resounded with the whistling of the rawhides
as they sped to their goal.</p>

<p>“Great work!” exclaimed Ki Yi. “Now, Sam, place
them under your arms.”</p>

<p>His fingers almost useless, so did the ranchman’s
hands tremble with fear, the work was slow.</p>

<p>Seeing that if they were not to be balked in their rescue,
quick action must be taken, Deadshot cried:</p>

<p>“Back to your pony, Ki Yi! Sling me your rope!
Sam can never get the nooses under his arms by himself.
I’ve got to help him!”</p>

<p>“But your weight added to his will be too much for
the pony! It’s almost out of sight now!” protested
Hawks.</p>

<p>“It’s up to you fellows to keep us from going down!”
returned the cowboy. “Keep your wits about you and
act quick—when I give the word!”</p>

<p>Never stopping to question his orders, Ki Yi had leaped
back to his broncho, seized his lasso and cast it deftly
over Deadshot’s shoulders.</p>

<p>Grasping the rawhide as it settled, the cowpuncher
slipped it under his arms and then, summoning all his
strength, jumped for the back of Bowser’s pony.</p>

<p>In breathless silence, the others watched.</p>

<p>Squarely he landed behind the ranchman’s back.</p>

<p>But to the horror of the spectators, the shock sent the
pony and Bowser down a foot.</p>

<p>“Turn your horses and ride for all your worth!”
yelled Deadshot.</p>

<p>And, as the men obeyed, he completed the work of slipping
the lariats beneath the ranchman’s arms.</p>

<p>Frantically the cowpunchers spurred their bronchos.</p>

<p>The lassos taughtened, then for a nerve-wracking moment
there was a silence as the men watched to see
whether they would be able to draw the two men from
the awful death.</p>

<p>Slowly at first, then rapidly, Bowser’s body was
dragged from the sucking mudhole, Deadshot clinging to
his back.</p>

<p>But, as the men were hauled to safety, there came a
terror-stricken shriek from the pony in the mudhole, followed
by the gloating swish of the brackish water as it
settled over the spot where the animal had disappeared!</p>

<p class="ph3">SLIPPERY NIG IDENTIFIES THE MIDNIGHT RAIDER.</p>


<p>As though fearful the same fate from which they had
so barely rescued the owner of the Double Cross might
Overtake them, the horsemen never paused until they were
on solid ground.</p>

<p>With careful hands, they loosed the lariats, the cruelly-torn
flesh of the ranchman revealing as nothing else
could the terrific force of the sucking mudhole, then
bound up his wounds in salve and linen which Deadshot
took from his saddlebags.</p>

<p>“Reckon we’ll have to find some other way of routing
out the Midnight Raider than trying to follow him
through the swamp,” exclaimed Bowser, with a feeble
attempt at a smile, after a drink of brandy had revived
him.</p>

<p>“No doubt about that!” asserted Hawks. “Even if
we could run across him, which we probably couldn’t,
he would be able to dispose of us very effectually by
luring us into one of those hellholes.”</p>

<p>“Then how <i>do</i> you propose to trail him to his lair?”
demanded Deadshot.</p>

<p>“That’s up to you and Ki Yi, as leaders, to figure out,”
returned the owner of the Star and Moon.</p>

<p>“The only way I can see is to start early in the morning
and follow the trail on foot,” suggested Dude.</p>

<p>“And run the additional danger of getting bitten by
copperhead and such like deadly snakes,” exclaimed another
of his companions, to whom the name of Grouch
had been given. “Not for mine, thank you.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t there some one who knows these bottom lands?”
asked Hawks. “I should think some of those old Piutes,
over by the catacombs, ought to know them. They say the
Injuns used them, in olden times, as a prison for their
captives.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span></p>

<p>“Man dear, but you’ve hit the nail on the head!” ejaculated
Deadshot, in delight. “There’s an ornery crittur,
part greaser, part Injun and part coon, whom I ran across
last summer, they call him ‘Slippery Nig,’ who knows
every mudhole and hummock of grass in the swamps.”</p>

<p>“Then he’s the bucko we want,” returned Ki Yi.
“The quickest way to get at the Midnight Raider is to
track him to his lair and surprise him. He probably
knows there isn’t a living white man who could scout
through those bottoms for twenty-four hours, so he
wouldn’t take any pains to keep a lookout, once he
reached his cover.”</p>

<p>“But, suppose we can’t find Slippery Nig, or he won’t
come, what then?” inquired Hawks. “Do you think
it would do any good to lay for the fellow to pot him
when he starts out on another raid?”</p>

<p>“Not unless you had three or four regiments of Uncle
Sam’s soldiers,” returned Deadshot. “The Sangammon
bottoms cover about ten square miles—and the farther
in you go the ornerier they get—so you can figure it out
for yourself how many men it would take to throw a cordon
round it.”</p>

<p>“Then, as far as I can see, the Nig is our only hope,”
declared Dude.</p>

<p>“Providing you can get him,” added Ki Yi. “How
about it, Deadshot, will he come, do you think?”</p>

<p>“He will if he’s in this part of the country.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be too sure,” interposed Grouch. “I’ve heard
of Slippery Nig before. They say if there’s one thing he
hates more than another, that same’s a white man.”</p>

<p>“That being so, what’s the use of wasting time trying
to find him?” demanded Bowser.</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t worry about his not coming, if he’s alive—and
I haven’t heard of his death,” rejoined Deadshot.
“Slippery Nig is under a trifling obligation to me—I
saved his life last summer when a couple of Injuns had
him cornered—so there’s no danger of his refusing. If
he does, I’ll send him where the bucks were going to.”</p>

<p>Realizing that the cowboy would, in consequence, be
able to obtain the assistance of the guide, could he be
located, Hawks asked, eagerly:</p>

<p>“How long will it take to find him? Where does he
hang out?”</p>

<p>“Over by the catacombs. I reckon if I take Ki Yi with
me, we can have him back here before sundown.”</p>

<p>“Then get a move on. We’ll wait right where we
are,” exclaimed the owner of the Double Cross. “What
with stealing my cattle and then causing me to get into
that death hole, it seems as though I couldn’t wait much
longer to get a shot at that raider.”</p>

<p>No urging, however, did the two cowboys need to make
them start on their quest for the old guide, and quickly
taking the freshest ponies in the lot, they were soon
galloping over the plains.</p>

<p>If ill luck had attended the beginning of the pursuit
of the Midnight Raider, it evidently repented of such
actions, for, before the cowboys had traversed more than
half the distance to the catacombs, they came upon the
object of their ride, squatting beside a fire, frying some
bacon on an old piece of tin.</p>

<p>At the sound of hoofbeats, the old guide had risen
cautiously from his place and scanned the horsemen,
though so craftily had he done the trick that neither of
the cowpunchers were aware of it. Deciding, however,
that they would not prove hostile, he had resumed his
cooking and was still engaged at it when the horsemen
rode up to him, after discovering the faint wraith of
smoke caused by his fire.</p>

<p>“Man, dear, but the sight of you does my eyes good!”
exclaimed Deadshot, slipping from his saddle and extending
his hand, which the old man accepted rather
suspiciously.</p>

<p>“What brings you over this way?” he asked, without
expressing either pleasure or surprise at beholding the
man to who he owed his life.</p>

<p>“Looking for you.”</p>

<p>“Huh?” And the tone in which he spoke showed that
the information was not welcome. “Nig no done nothing.
Besides, you told me you was a cowman.”</p>

<p>“So I am,” laughed the member of the Double Cross
outfit. “What have you been up to now, you old rascal,
that you’re afraid the officers are looking for you?”</p>

<p>But the old guide ignored the question, repeating his
own as to the purpose of Deadshot’s search for him.</p>

<p>Briefly the cowboy told him about the lone spectre’s
raids and the vain pursuit.</p>

<p>At the tale, Slippery Nig’s eyes sparkled and there
came into them a look of vengeance which mystified the
cowpunchers.</p>

<p>But only for a minute.</p>

<p>Even before either of them had the chance to ask the
cause, the old man spoke.</p>

<p>“You know him raider?” he queried.</p>

<p>“No, do you?” chorused both the cowboys, exchanging
significant glances.</p>

<p>“Sure. Only one heap fool alike that.”</p>

<p>“Who is it, then?”</p>

<p>“You remember Injun bucks last summer?” he asked,
looking at the man who had rescued him from them.</p>

<p>“You bet I do!” returned Deadshot.</p>

<p>“Fool raider, him one—Scalping Louie.”</p>

<p>“Not really?” cried the cowmen, in amazement, for the
name was that of a renegade redskin whose chief delight
was to scalp helpless women and children, and for whom
there was a reward offered by the Indian agent on the
reservation from which he had escaped only a month or
so before.</p>

<p>“That him, Scalping Louie,” repeated Nig. “Me just
heard day, two day ago, he broke way from reserve again.
That why me here.”</p>

<p>These words were uttered with such grim significance
that the cowboys realized without the necessity of asking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
or being told that the old scout was on the trail of the
Midnight Raider.</p>

<p>“Then you’ll help us run him down?” inquired Ki Yi,
with a wink at his companion.</p>

<p>“Uhuh! Me go.”</p>

<p>“Good boy! Don’t bother to cook that bacon. Get
up behind me and we’ll go back to the rest of the bunch
and then you can eat all you want to,” exclaimed Deadshot,
scarcely able to restrain his delight that the task he
had feared might even necessitate a resort to force had
been accomplished without the making of any promise
or offer of reward.</p>

<p>“All right, me go. No need ride with you, got own
pinto.”</p>

<p>This statement that the old scout had a pony with him
amazed his hearers, and in surprise they looked about
to see where the animal could be.</p>

<p>For a moment, Nig enjoyed the mystification of the
cowpunchers, then finally got to his feet.</p>

<p>“Cowmen no know all Injun trick,” he chuckled.
“Long ago, Injun had be heap smart. Deadshot could
fool paleface. Me show.”</p>

<p>Eagerly the two men followed Nig, wondering whether
or not he was playing a joke on them, or leading them into
a trap.</p>

<p>But their suspicions of the old scout were quickly allayed.</p>

<p>Scarce a rod had they gone from the fire than the
old scout stopped, bent over, swept aside the grass with
his hand and beckoned to his companions.</p>

<p>There, stretched flat on its side where it had been
deftly, covered with mesquite, lay a flea-bitten pony.</p>

<p>“Man, dear, but that’s some trick!” ejaculated Deadshot,
in undisguised admiration of the cleverness with
which the animal had been hidden.</p>

<p>“That’s what!” acquiesced Ki Yi. “How do you do
it, Nig?”</p>

<p>“Train um pinto.”</p>

<p>“So I suppose. Sounds easy enough, but how in the
world do you manage to make the crittur lie so still he
won’t even make the grass move unnaturally?”</p>

<p>“Train um pinto. Injun pony no fool.”</p>

<p>“So it seems. But, just the same, I don’t see how you
can rig up the grass, even after you’ve taught the pony
to lie still,” declared Deadshot.</p>

<p>“Me show—after get Louie.”</p>

<p>Thus recalled to the business in hand, the two cowboys
watched Nig as he turned to go back to the campfire,
uttering a sharp command in some half-breed lingo
which brought the pony to its feet as he did so.</p>

<p>“Say, if you and I knew as much as that old codger,
we could get the finest job in Uncle Sam’s Mounted
Scouts,” exclaimed Ki Yi, enthusiastically. “I’ll bet he
has forgotten more than any other scout on the plains
to-day ever knew.”</p>

<p>“No chance for an argument there,” returned the other
cowboy. “I wouldn’t be in Scalping Louie’s shoes for
all the money in the United States treasury.”</p>

<p>Put in an excellent humor by the praise of the cowpunchers,
for he realized the praise of these men of the
plains was the appreciation of men who knew, Slippery
Nig quickly, and with an agility amazing in one of his
years, vaulted onto the back of his pinto and headed toward
the South.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3">THE PLAINSMEN ARE OUTWITTED.</p>


<p>As the queer trio loped along to the camp where the
rest of the avengers were eagerly awaiting the return
of the two cowboys and hoping against hope that they
would be successful, not only in locating the old Indian
scout, but in persuading him to lend his skill and assistance
in running the Midnight Raider to his lair, Slippery
Nig regaled his companions with tales of his past exploits.
And many were the pointers he gave his eager
listeners as to trailing and woodcraft.</p>

<p>But when they drew near their destination, the old
scout grew reticent and by the time they reached their
fellows, he was as stolid of feature and as taciturn as
the proverbial Indian chieftain.</p>

<p>“What luck?” called Bowser, as the tramp of the
ponies reached the ears of the waiting men.</p>

<p>“We’ve got him,” returned Ki Yi.</p>

<p>In delight, all the cowboys, Hawks and even the suffering
owner of the Double Cross ranch got to their
feet and hastened to greet and get a glimpse of the man
upon whose skill they were depending to send the spectral
raider to his much-deserved doom.</p>

<p>“Hello, old chap!” exclaimed Bowser, extending his
hand cordially to the old scout. “I’m sure glad Deadshot
found you. We’re in a mighty bad way, as I suppose he’s
told you.”</p>

<p>But Slippery Nig made no more move to shake the
hand or return the greeting than if the owner of the
Double Cross were not in existence.</p>

<p>“Surly old duffer, ain’t he?” grinned Dude.</p>

<p>Yet even this comment upon his manner failed to draw
a sign from the aged scout that he was aware of the
presence of the cowboys and the ranchmen.</p>

<p>Nonplused by the refusal of their advances, the men
gazed at one another in perplexity, deeming that it was
necessary for the success of the pursuit that they should
win Nig’s good graces. Even a word from Deadshot
failed to elicit any response, and they were at their
wits’ ends to know what to do to restore his good humor,
when Grouch chanced to solve the mystery of his
taciturnity.</p>

<p>“Perhaps he’s deaf,” the Star and Moon cowpuncher
whispered to Dude.</p>

<p>This aspersion upon his faculties unloosed the floodgates.</p>

<p>“Me no deaf,” snorted the aged scout. “Neither is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
Scalping Louie. No wonder paleface no get near um.
Make noise like squaws. Louie maybe hear um and cum
see um. See Nig and vamoose. Paleface heap fool.
Louie think Nig in swamp, break for anywhere. Nig
have heap trouble trailing him. Paleface either shut um
mouth, or Nig no help.”</p>

<p>“What’s it all about?” asked Hawks, turning to the
cowboys who had fetched the old scout for an explanation
of the torrent of wrath. “Who’s this Louie, anyhow?
What’s he got to do with us? Doesn’t the old duffer
know it’s the Midnight Raider we’re after?”</p>

<p>“Easy, easy,” grinned Deadshot. “One question at a
time.”</p>

<p>“All right. I’ll keep quiet,” returned the owner of the
Star and Moon, “only for pity’s sake get busy, and explain
what we’ve done to bring down the wrath of this
old curmudgeon upon our heads.”</p>

<p>“In the first place, your Midnight Raider is no other
than Scalping Louie, the renegade chief from the Piute
reservation, whose specialty is descending upon lone
ranch houses and settlements and scalping all the women,
children and old men he can lay his hands on. He’s
broken from the reservation goodness only knows how
many times—it seems he was one of the parties from
whom I saved Nig last summer—and he’s broken out
again within a few weeks.”</p>

<p>If the cowboy desired to produce a sensation by this
statement, he succeeded beyond his fondest dreams.</p>

<p>In blank amazement, the men stared at one another and
then from Deadshot to old Nig.</p>

<p>“Skull and crossbones, as Sandy says!” exclaimed
Bowser. “No wonder we have been outwitted by the
fiend. Why, he’s the most dangerous Indian in the country.
Only the other day, when I was at the Centre, I
signed a petition asking that the devil be sent to the
United States prison at Leavenworth—where he couldn’t
break out any more.”</p>

<p>“And so did I,” interposed Hawks.</p>

<p>“Then it’s dollars to a coyote flea that’s why you two
were singled out as the first objects of his wrath,” declared
Ki Yi. “He probably heard in some way that
you’d put your names to the petition, and then later that
you’d both gone out on the range to round up and drive in
your steers for market. His intentions were, more’n
likely, to add Sarah’s and Amy’s scalps to his collections,
but finding you had both returned, he vented his wrath
upon Sam by driving off his cattle and leaving a trail big
enough for a baby to find leading into the Sangammon
bottom lands, so’s he could get you into one of those
mudholes. And when he found Hen was back, he decided
to vary operations by burning the home outfit.”</p>

<p>Though this speech was the longest consecutive one the
cowboy had ever made in his life and was somewhat involved,
the others followed it closely, their thorough concurrence
in the views signified by frequent noddings of
their heads.</p>

<p>But the final touch of approval came from Slippery
Nig.</p>

<p>“<i>Some</i> paleface plenty wise,” he declared, his weather-beaten
and battle-scarred face breaking into a smile of
praise.</p>

<p>“Keep on talking, you two, you’ll soon have him really
pleasant,” chuckled Bowser.</p>

<p>And, in obedience, Deadshot took up the task of interpreting
Nig’s remarks where he had left off when Ki Yi
began his explanation of the raids.</p>

<p>“Nig, knowing Louie’s cunning, did not like the way
you-all greeted us when we came up. He’s out on a little
scouting party for Louie himself—on account of that performance
in which I played the part of the hero, I suppose.</p>

<p>“That’s probably one of the principal reasons why he
agreed to join forces with us. And, because he’s out on
this little trip, he doesn’t want us to make so much noise
that Louie will come snooping round to find what’s doing
and get wise to the fact that Nig is with us. For, if
there is anybody slicker in trailing and such things than
Louie, it’s Nig—and Louie knows it.</p>

<p>“Consequently, if Louie should see Nig with us, he
would know he was on the war path and light out—which
would spoil what seems like a lovely little chance for Nig
to save Uncle Sam a lot of expense by putting him where
he can’t take any more scalps.”</p>

<p>Another grin of approval from the aged scout greeted
this elucidation of his caustic comment.</p>

<p>“Then, as I understand it, what Nig wants is for us
to keep quiet?” inquired Bowser.</p>

<p>“Heap quiet,” chuckled the scout.</p>

<p>“All right, we will—especially as it seems to be sound
sense,” returned the owner of the Double Cross. “Now,
suppose you ask him what he intends to do, Deadshot.”</p>

<p>Without delay, the cowboy put the question, while his
companions awaited eagerly for Nig’s response.</p>

<p>And, after several minutes, their curiosity was gratified.</p>

<p>“First, must see trail, learn where goes.”</p>

<p>“But we can’t follow it, we’ve tried it once and pretty
nearly lost Bowser in the attempt,” exclaimed Hawks.</p>

<p>“Me no say follow um,” returned the scout, in disgust.
“Me say want to see where um goes.”</p>

<p>“What good will that do?” queried Ki Yi.</p>

<p>“Me know where Louie pitch teppee, burn him out.”</p>

<p>“By thunder, that’s the idea!” ejaculated the owner
of the Double Cross, unable to restrain his delight at the
suggestion. “Want any help from any of us?”</p>

<p>“Uhuh! Me take Deadshot and Ki Yi. Palefaces stay
here till we come back.”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry about our going away,” smiled Hawks,
“and we’ll keep all-fired quiet, too.”</p>

<p>“Good. We no be back till burn Louie out. Palefaces
stay on edge of swamp. When see um fire, watch out.
This only trail to Louie’s teppee. Palefaces stay here and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
when Louie come, shoot um. We stay on other side so
shoot Louie if run that way.”</p>

<p>“But how about the North and South? Won’t you
need some guards for them?” queried Bowser.</p>

<p>“Naw. No trail to South or North. Mudhole too
bad, ’cept near catacombs.”</p>

<p>“Then hurry up and be going,” exclaimed Hawks.
“This scheme looks like a rip-snorter to me. You won’t
be gone five minutes before I’ll have the others in positions
from which they can sweep the trail.”</p>

<p>“Huh! Palefaces watch out no shoot too soon. Louie
hear shot, he dodge.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I reckon palefaces aren’t such fools they can’t
tell a man front a shadow,” retorted Bowser.</p>

<p>“Mebbe. But animals, um come from swamp ’fore
Louie. Animal smell um fire before mans.”</p>

<p>“Then we’ll be on the lookout. Now hurry—and good
luck.”</p>

<p>“And don’t forget that the success of this whole
scheme lies in you-all keeping dead quiet,” cautioned
Deadshot as he and Ki Yi followed Slippery Nig into the
trail.</p>

<p>But, despite this warning, the bunch of avengers, sitting
tense and alert for the appearance of the Midnight
Raider, again fell prey to him!</p>

<p>With a cleverness that was uncanny, the old scout
led the way through the swamps, seeming to travel all
the time over firm ground, with such skill did he avoid
the mudholes.</p>

<p>And, as the cowboys were marveling at his ability, he
suddenly halted his pinto and raised his hand for them
to stop, putting a finger to his lips to enjoin silence and
then, when they had drawn rein, pointing with his other
hand toward the tops of the trees some thirty yards ahead.</p>

<p>Quickly following the direction, the cowpunchers beheld
a faint wreath of smoke floating lazily off into the
air.</p>

<p>And, as they realized that their quarry was in his
teppee, their hearts beat like trip-hammers.</p>

<p>But not long were they allowed to enjoy the sight.</p>

<p>Again the old scout raised his hand, this time beckoning
to them to ride close to him.</p>

<p>“Must be careful now,” he whispered. “Must get on
other side of teppee so set fire. Wind from South. We
go North. Louie no smell.”</p>

<p>Wondering how their aged guide could detect the direction
of the wind when they were not even aware there
was any stirring, at least, not sufficient to carry their
odor to the shrewd old fiend, the cowboys followed his
lead. But, though as before, Nig picked out only firm
ground for them to ride on, he made frequent halts while
he listened and sniffed, once or twice even dismounting
and reconnoitring on foot.</p>

<p>After what seemed to them several hours, so slowly did
they advance, Nig gave the word to halt.</p>

<p>“Isn’t there any more danger of his hearing us?”
queried Ki Yi, surprised to hear the aged scout speak.</p>

<p>“No make difference now,” he replied.</p>

<p>“Why not?” exclaimed both cowboys, together.</p>

<p>“Because we on South side of teppee.”</p>

<p>“But I thought that was the side you wanted especially
to avoid?” remarked Deadshot.</p>

<p>“While we getting here, uhuh. Now no difference.
Palefaces at head of trail. If Louie smell us now, he no
think any there and they shoot um.”</p>

<p>During this conversation, the aged scout had been
preparing some grass which he braided with amazing
rapidity into a long strand and then cut into three pieces,
two of which he gave to his companions.</p>

<p>“What are these for?” they asked, in chorus.</p>

<p>“Torches.”</p>

<p>“But I never saw any like these,” exclaimed Ki Yi,
examining his braid sceptically.</p>

<p>“No go out easy, no burn too quick.”</p>

<p>And without other explanation, Nig lighted his, and,
dismounting, began to kindle a row of fires in such a direction
that the increasing wind would sweep them down
upon the retreat of the Midnight Raider.</p>

<p>At first, it was necessary to rekindle the fires in several
places, especially where the cowpunchers had applied their
torches. But, at last, being shown how to avoid the wet
undergrass and light only the dry tops and the upper
part of the underbrush, they soon had a leaping wall of
flame raging through the swamp.</p>

<p>As the wind steadily grew stronger, Nig’s face was
wreathed in smiles.</p>

<p>“Palefaces watch out, we get Louie, sure,” he chuckled.
“Came near not, though,” he added. “When we coming
round by teppee he come nigh smelling us.”</p>

<p>“How was that? We weren’t anywhere near his teppee,
were we?” asked Deadshot, surprised at the thought.</p>

<p>“Uhuh. Mebbe ten feet, mebbe rod.”</p>

<p>At this reply, the cowpunchers stared at one another
in amazement.</p>

<p>“If we were so near, why didn’t you sneak up and put
a bullet into him?” queried Ki Yi.</p>

<p>“Louie snooping. Me no know where, but me fool
um.” And again he chuckled at the realization his cunning
had outwitted his mortal enemy.</p>

<p>But their rejoicing was premature. In their calculations,
they had forgotten the cattle.</p>

<p>As it happened, the steers were grazing not far from
where they had kindled the fires, and quickly the creatures
sensed the danger, lowing and groaning.</p>

<p>“That will give the alarm to Louie, won’t it?” anxiously
inquired Deadshot.</p>

<p>“Uhuh. But steers never get through swamp.”</p>

<p>Yet, though Slippery Nig was right in this contention,
the animals came near causing the death of the trio.</p>

<p>With that perversity which makes steers so impossible
to rely on, and because many animals are prone to rush<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
into fire instead of away from it, the cattle charged directly
at the wall of flame.</p>

<p>Instantly realizing this action, and knowing the danger
with which it threatened them, Nig leaped upon his pony
and, calling to the others to mount behind him and abandon
their own horses, he guided the wiry little pinto to
a place of safety just at the edge of the fire. But, even
with such a distance between them and the spot where
they had been standing, they were only able to save
themselves by shooting three steers that thundered down
upon them.</p>

<p>Growing impatient as time went by without any action,
the rest of the avengers were suddenly roused to attention
by the discovery of the glow from the flames.</p>

<p>“Where’ll we put the ponies?” asked Dude. “We
ought to have them far enough away so they won’t be
frightened by the fire.”</p>

<p>“Take ’em out a couple of hundred yards on the
plains,” directed the owner of the Double Cross. “They’ll
be safe there, and we can reach them in time to dash to
the South before the flames get us.”</p>

<p>Quickly this order was obeyed, and the men spread out
to cover as much ground as possible, that their quarry
might not escape them.</p>

<p>Eagerly they awaited a sight of Scalping Louie, guns
held against their shoulders.</p>

<p>But, though denizens of the swamps, of all sorts and
descriptions, swarmed forth, never the sight of a human
being did they catch.</p>

<p>Already the heat of the flames was becoming intense.</p>

<p>“Do you think he’s got by us?” shouted Bowser to
Hawks.</p>

<p>“I don’t see how X——”</p>

<p>But his words were never finished.</p>

<p>For, even as he was speaking, there rang out above
the roar of the fire, a piercing “O-u-e-e!”</p>

<p>Instantly the avengers whirled toward the plains.</p>

<p>Waving his hand in derision, the lone horseman was
racing Southward, driving the ponies of his pursuers
ahead of him.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3">A THRILLING RESCUE.</p>


<p>Cursing and howling in fury, to think that they had
again been outwitted by the Midnight Raider, the cowboys
pumped shell after shell at the fleeing horseman.</p>

<p>As before, he seemed to ride unscathed through the
leaden hail—and their inability to hit the horseman only
added to their anger.</p>

<p>Dude and Grouch had raced out onto the plains in the
futile attempt to overtake the fugitive on foot. But at
last they even gave up shooting at him.</p>

<p>“What’ll old Slippery Nig say to us <i>now</i>, I wonder?”
exclaimed the owner of the Star and Moon, as they stood
gazing after their fast-disappearing foe.</p>

<p>“He won’t have the chance to say anything if we
don’t hike out of here mighty quick,” returned Bowser.</p>

<p>“Come on, men, run to the South for your lives!”</p>

<p>This command recalled the fire to the avengers for the
first time since they were made aware that the Midnight
Raider had tricked them.</p>

<p>Gazing toward it, they realized they were in greater
danger than they had ever been from Scalping Louie.</p>

<p>By leaps and bounds, it seemed to be sweeping down
upon them, its billows of smoke already causing them to
cough and choke.</p>

<p>“Turn your heads to the open plains and run low!”
shouted Hawks. “Two hundred yards will bring us beyond
the edge of the wall of flame. The wind is already
driving it more to the North!”</p>

<p>Desperately the cowboys put forth every bit of their
strength in frantic effort to reach the zone of safety.
And each thought only of himself.</p>

<p>As a result, it was not until they had gained a spot
behind the death-dealing wall of flame that they gave
thought to one another.</p>

<p>But, when they did, they found that one of their number
was missing!</p>

<p>“Where’s Sam?” demanded Dude, looking from one
to another of his fellows, in alarm.</p>

<p>For a moment, the thought that one of their band had
fallen prey to the inexorable fire, filled them with horror.</p>

<p>“He must have fallen,” murmured Hawks.</p>

<p>“Shall we go back, for him?” asked Grouch.</p>

<p>“And lose your life, too? No. One life is enough to give
to that raiding devil without sacrificing another in
a useless attempt. Some of us should have thought of
giving Sam assistance, seeing that he was unable to take
care of himself because of the wounds made by the lariats
when we dragged him from the mudhole. But it’s no
use to try to save him now. We don’t know where he
fell, and the smoke is already upon him. Poor fellow!”</p>

<p>Though they accepted the decision of the ranchman,
realizing that it would, indeed, be madness for any one on
foot to attempt the rescue, the thought of the man they
so revered meeting such an horrible fate was more than
they could bear, and, seemingly with one accord, they
faced away from the wall of flames and threw themselves
into the grass that they might not see the fire sweep
up the plains—and devour the owner of the Double Cross
ranch.</p>

<p>But, even as they despaired, expecting every instant to
hear the agonized shriek that would announce the rush
of the flames upon Bowser, help was speeding to him by
leaps and bounds!</p>

<p>When Sandy had been advised by Ki Yi to take Mrs.
Hawks to the Double Cross and then, getting Pinky, ride
to join the rest of the avengers, he lost no time in putting
the suggestion into effect.</p>

<p>“Why, man, what brings you back? Why aren’t you
riding with the others?” exclaimed the woman. “I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
should think they were short handed enough, as it was,
to capture that villain without leaving you behind.”</p>

<p>“That’s the way it looked to me, Mrs. Hawks, but
Sam got mad at me and told me to give Ki Yi my pony
and come back here to stay with you.”</p>

<p>And rapidly he narrated the incidents that had brought
about the unhorsing of the pursuing cowboy and his own
humiliation.</p>

<p>Sympathetically the woman listened.</p>

<p>“Sam always was hot tempered,” she declared. “And
then he only listens to the last one who has his ear. I’ve
always told Hen so—and this business proves it. Still,
I’m mighty glad you came back. I was beginning to feel
scared, all alone here. It’s no place to leave a woman,
with her home in ruins and all those cattle in the corral.”</p>

<p>Groaning as he realized from this torrent of words
that even the events of the night would not stop the
woman’s loquacity, the foreman cursed silently to himself.</p>

<p>But he was given little time to indulge in his own
thoughts.</p>

<p>“Who knows, it may be an act of Providence that
you’ve come back,” rattled on the woman. “Like as not,
something will happen before morning that will give you
a chance to show your worth and make us all glad you
didn’t go. Let’s go over to the corral and see how the cattle
are. I’ve got to be doing something. There’s no house
to go into and——”</p>

<p>“That’s just what I was agoing to speak to you about,”
exclaimed Sandy, interrupting. “It’s no fit place for a
lady to be—here on the plains with her home in ruins and
no roof or nothing to protect from storms and no food
to eat.”</p>

<p>“You never spoke a truer word, Sandy. But what
can we do? Now, you’re here, I don’t propose to let you
go and leave me while you ride to the Centre for provisions
or anything.”</p>

<p>“Why not go over to the Double Cross?” suggested
the foreman. “You and Mrs. Bowser could get along
together—you’d be company for each other, so you
wouldn’t feel afraid—and that being so, it would let
Pinky and me go to join Sam and the rest of them.”</p>

<p>For several minutes the woman considered the proposition,
without making any comment.</p>

<p>By watching her face closely, thanks to the light from
the still glowing ruins, the foreman could see from its
expression that his suggestion had appealed to her, and
this was proved by her words.</p>

<p>“Do you think it would be right for me to leave the
cattle?” she queried, anxiously. “Something might happen
to them—or they might be raided.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t see how you could do very much, either
to stop the raid or to help, if trouble broke out,” replied
Sandy, a smile lighting his face. “If there’s one thing
more than another that will stir up a restless crittur, it’s
a woman. And you sure wouldn’t be able to stand off a
gang of raiders.”</p>

<p>“No-o, I suppose not,” returned the woman, hesitatingly.
“Still, if anything <i>should</i> go wrong, and I wasn’t
here, Hen would never forgive me.”</p>

<p>Only too well did the foreman realize the truth of this
statement, thoroughly familiar as he was with the nature
and disposition of the owner of the Star and Moon ranch.
But he was determined to rejoin his fellow avengers, and,
as an idea came into his mind, he exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Hen didn’t think anything about <i>you</i> when he started
after that raider. I don’t see why you should put yourself
in danger. If it hadn’t been for my row with Sam,
I wouldn’t be here now—and then you would have been
in a bad fix, without food, shelter or ponies. It strikes
me that, under the circumstance, the thing for you to
do is to think only of yourself and come with me to the
Double Cross.”</p>

<p>“But how would we get there? We haven’t any ponies
and I surely can’t walk thirty miles through the grass.”</p>

<p>“I’ll fix that all right, if that’s all is keeping you. It
won’t take me more than an hour or so, perhaps not that
long, to round up a couple of the bronchos and then we
can start.”</p>

<p>“Then get busy and catch ’em,” exclaimed the woman.
“I kind of hate to leave the ranch this way—but Hen
Hawks had no business to leave me all alone by myself!”</p>

<p>Waiting never a minute, least the woman repent of her
decision, Sandy set out to round up two of the ponies,
smiling to himself as he went out onto the plains at Mrs.
Hawks’ passionate outburst.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t be in Hen Hawks’ place when he <i>does</i> get
back for all the cattle in that corral,” he grinned.</p>

<p>Thanks to his skill, it did not take the foreman long to
catch a couple of the bronchos, and, though they were
obliged to ride without saddles or even blankets and with
bridles improvised from bits of rawhide lariats which
Sandy found, in due course they were on their way to the
home ranch of the Double Cross, which they reached
soon after daybreak.</p>

<p>In horror, Mrs. Bowser listened to her friend’s excited
recital of the events of the night before.</p>

<p>But, when Sandy announced his intention of taking
Pinky and riding to the Sangammon swamps for the purpose
of rejoining the band of avengers, she refused to
permit him.</p>

<p>“What, leave us two women alone and unprotected?”
she exclaimed. “Shame on you for thinking of such a
thing, Sandy! Who knows but that terrible white raider,
learning that all the men from the Double Cross and the
Star and Moon ranches are chasing him, may come back
and burn our buildings, too?”</p>

<p>In vain the foreman protested he had received orders
from Bowser to follow, if possible, declaring that the
greatest safeguard against further raids was to capture
the raider.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Bowser was adamant, however, and in her position
Mrs. Hawks ably backed her up.</p>

<p>Giving up the idea for the moment, Sandy went back
to the horse corral, taking Pinky with him.</p>

<p>“What’s to be done?” demanded the latter, when they
were safe from being overheard.</p>

<p>“I’m going!” declared the foreman, with emphasis.
“You sneak into the bunkhouse and pack some grub for
our saddlebags. Better put in a good supply because the
others will probably be running short. I’ll catch a couple
of the best ponies and make ’em ready. When you’ve
stowed the grub, come on out here. We’ll mount and
ride up to the ranchhouse. Seeing that we’re determined
to go, anyhow, the women will probably give their consent.”</p>

<p>“And if they don’t?”</p>

<p>“We’ll just ride away.”</p>

<p>Satisfied with this arrangement, Pinky hurried off to
carry out his part of it, rejoining his companion in due
course.</p>

<p>Quickly mounting, but not without many misgivings,
the two cowboys cantered round to the veranda of the
ranchhouse where they knew the women were sitting.</p>

<p>Even before they had come in sight, Mrs. Bowser heard
the hoofbeats and went to learn their cause.</p>

<p>“What are you two boys going to do?” she demanded.</p>

<p>“Join Sam and the rest,” returned Sandy.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, you’re not; not while Amy and I are here
all alone!” exclaimed the woman, resolutely.</p>

<p>And with a lightning movement, she turned to the side
of the veranda, picked up a rifle and leveled it at the rebellious
cowpunchers ere they could realize exactly what
was happening.</p>

<p>“<i>Now</i> do you think you’ll go?” demanded Mrs. Bowser,
grimly. “If you don’t turn round and ride back to
the corral, dismount and promise not to try any such
tricks again, I’ll—I’ll shoot you!”</p>

<p>Not relishing being in front of the death-dealing
weapon pointed at him, especially when it was in the
hands of a nervous woman—for he realized it might be
discharged accidentally any moment—the foreman pretended
to yield.</p>

<p>“All right! You seem to be the doctor,” he replied,
wheeling his horse, and at the same time winking at Pinky
to let him know he had evolved another scheme to carry
out his purpose.</p>

<p>“Well, I rather guess I’m the doctor—and you’ll find
it out!” retorted Mrs. Bowser.</p>

<p>“Put down the rifle, won’t you?” pleaded Sandy. “It
might go off without you intending it should. Now,
we’re not going, you don’t need it.”</p>

<p>“Say, you fellows must think I <i>am</i> easy,” smiled the
woman. “I won’t put it down—and what’s more, Amy
and I are going to follow you with it to the corral, so
you won’t have the chance to give us the slip!”</p>

<p>It having been the foreman’s purpose, after persuading
Mrs. Bowser to lay aside the rifle, to make a dash for
the plains, when he realized from the determined woman’s
words that his scheme was frustrated, he relieved his
feelings by cursing.</p>

<p>But a way out of the difficulty was presented in an
unexpected manner!</p>

<p>Ere the cowboys had ridden a rod back toward the
horse yard, both they and the two women were amazed
to hear hoofbeats.</p>

<p>Wheeling in their saddles, at the same time whipping
out their six shooters, that they might not be caught unawares
in case the newcomers proved more raiders, the
cowpunchers were surprised to see a man and a woman
canter over the rise in the plains that led into the yard
of the Double Cross home ranch.</p>

<p>At the sight of Mrs. Bowser with the rifle in her hands
and the two horsemen with revolvers drawn, the newcomers
drew rein, abruptly.</p>

<p>“What’s wrong, Sarah?” called the man, at the same
time dropping his hand to his own shooting iron.</p>

<p>“Well, Charlie and Mary Harris, if I’m not glad to
see you!” cried Mrs. Bowser, running out to meet the
couple, whom she had recognized as friends of hers from
the Centre.</p>

<p>“Then, for goodness sakes! put down that rifle!”
called the woman. “You may be glad to see us, but I
don’t feel over safe with that thing pointed at me.”</p>

<p>Quickly the other woman obeyed.</p>

<p>Explanations of the surprising scene which had greeted
the newcomers were quickly asked and given.</p>

<p>“Now that we’re here, there’s no reason why the boys
can’t go ahead and join Sam and Hen,” exclaimed Harris.
“If they’ve got to search the Sangammon bottoms,
two more men will be mighty welcome to them. I wish
I could go myself,” he added, wistfully.</p>

<p>“Well, you can’t, so you might just as well get that
notion right out of your head!” retorted his companion,
who was his wife. “It’ll be bad enough to have only one
man.”</p>

<p>Fearing that some whim of the women might deprive
them of this unexpected opportunity to go to their fellows,
Sandy again wheeled his horse and rode up to the
group.</p>

<p>“Then, we can go, Mrs. Bowser?” he asked, gathering
up his reins and drawing his feet back ready to bury the
rowels of his spurs in his pony’s flanks the instant permission
was given.</p>

<p>“You think it will be all right, Charlie?” she asked,
turning to her friend from the Centre.</p>

<p>“Sure thing. Besides, Sam and Hen will certainly
need every man they can get!”</p>

<p>“All right, you may go,” exclaimed Mrs. Bowser.
“And good luck to you!” she called.</p>

<p>For, no sooner had Sandy and Pinky heard the first
words of her reply than they leaped their ponies forward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
and were racing over the plains before the permission was
fairly out of her mouth.</p>

<p>Being mounted on the fleetest horses that the Double
Cross boasted, they traveled fast, sparing neither their
horses nor themselves in their desire to join the other
avengers as soon as possible.</p>

<p>From afar, they caught sight of the fire sweeping over
the bottoms.</p>

<p>“They’ve trailed the fiend and are trying to burn him
out!” cried the foreman, in exultation. “Come on,
man, ride like the old Nick, so we can be in at the killing!”</p>

<p>All eagerness, the two cowpunchers rode with quirt
and spur.</p>

<p>Scarce two miles away were they when they suddenly
beheld a figure dart from the underbrush, scan the plains
before him hastily and then make a dash for the bunch
of ponies standing to the South.</p>

<p>“That’s the raider! He’s got away from them! Ride
him down!” yelled Pinky.</p>

<p>But, even as he spoke, the daredevil renegade, as the
reader knows, had leaped upon one of the ponies, and,
waving his arms, scattered the others to the four points
of the winds.</p>

<p>An instant later, Bowser and the other avengers, who
had been outwitted by Scalping Louie, dashed from the
swamps and began their frantic but futile firing at the
fugitive, which they quickly forsook, as the reader knows,
in order to save their own lives.</p>

<p>A moment, Sandy and his companion, never slackening
their pace, hesitated whether to go in pursuit of the raider
or to ride to the relief of their friends.</p>

<p>And as they tried to decide which to do, they beheld
Bowser fall.</p>

<p>“Someone’s down! We must save him!” shouted the
foreman to his bunkmate. And together they rode with
might and main.</p>

<p>But little did they think the fallen man was their master!</p>

<p>Being the heavier man Sandy’s pony was tiring
rapidly.</p>

<p>“Ride, man, I can’t last!” he shouted.</p>

<p>Bending low over his saddle, Pinky rowelled deep furrows
in the flanks of his broncho.</p>

<p>Gamely the beast responded.</p>

<p>The blanket of suffocating smoke was almost upon
the prostrate form of the owner of the Double Cross.</p>

<p>Less than fifty feet away was Pinky.</p>

<p>Leaning far to one side of his saddle, the cowboy
raced up, just as the hot, choking black pall settled
over the spot where the ranchman lay.</p>

<p>Having taken keen sight of where the body lay, Pinky
made a desperate grab.</p>


<p>To his intense joy, his fingers caught in the man’s belt.</p>

<p>Tightening his hold, the cowboy turned his pony’s
head, gave a terrific jab with his spurs—and swept from
the cloud of smoke, dragging the body with him!</p>

</div>

<p class="ph3">THE AGED SCOUT GIVES AN EXHIBITION OF HIS ABILITY.</p>


<p>“Well done, man! Well done, Pinky!” shouted
Sandy.</p>

<p>And with all speed possible he rode to the assistance
of his bunkmate, as, with Bowser in his clutch, the cowboy
emerged from the very grasp of death.</p>

<p>Not a moment too soon did he arrive!</p>

<p>Blinded by the hot smoke, choking and coughing, the
cowboy from the Double Cross outfit was reeling in his
saddle, his strength having given out after the rescue of
his employer, though he still unconsciously clutched Bowser’s
belt.</p>

<p>But, before he fell Sandy’s strong arm encircled him.</p>

<p>Because of their horror at seeing one of their number
give his life to the relentless wall of flames, as they supposed,
Hawks and the men with him had not seen the
thrilling rescue and it was not till they heard the foreman’s
shout of congratulation to Pinky that they had
any idea there was any one near them.</p>

<p>No sooner had his words rung out, however, than they
were upon their feet and quickly they swarmed about the
prostrate form of the man they had given up as dead and
his rescuers.</p>

<p>Even when they saw him saved, the narrowness of
the ranchman’s escape from such a horrible fate held
them silent as they anxiously poured brandy and other
stimulants down his throat.</p>

<p>But it was not many minutes before they were afforded
the joyous relief of seeing Bowser open his eyes.</p>

<p>Thus satisfied that their fellow had, indeed, been saved
in time, Dude and the others turned their attention to
Pinky, who was quickly revived, while Hawks talked with
Sandy.</p>

<p>The owner of the Double Cross ranch, however, was
aware that he had not been saved by any of the three
men who had been hiding in the bushes to intercept the
Midnight Raider. Indeed, his last memory was of seeing
them dashing for safety, giving no heed to his desperate
call for assistance. And as his mind came back to
its normal condition, he asked, feebly:</p>

<p>“Who—who saved me?”</p>

<p>“Pinky!” returned several voices.</p>

<p>“Pinky? Why—why—what’s he doing here? I
thought he was back at the ranch, looking after Sarah?”
Then, another idea flashed into his mind, and he asked,
“There—hasn’t anything <i>more</i> happened at home, has
there?”</p>

<p>“Not a thing, Sam,” exclaimed his foreman, moving
to where his master could see him.</p>

<p>“What, you here, too?” ejaculated Bowser.</p>

<p>“Yes, Charlie Harris and his wife came over to see
Sarah, and he told us to join you—and from the fix<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
Pinky found you in, I reckon it was an all-fired good
thing we come just when we did!”</p>

<p>“No doubt about that,” returned the ranchman. “To
say nothing of saving me, we’ll need you before we run
that cowlifter down. But I thought I left you at the
Star and Moon?”</p>

<p>Briefly Sandy told him of his actions, not even omitting
a description of the scene when Mrs. Bowser had held
them from leaving the ranch at the point of her rifle,
knowing full well that the woman would tell about it
upon their return and believing it would seem less serious
when his master was still in forceful remembrance of the
fact that the timely arrival of his two men was all that
had saved his life.</p>

<p>As the picture of the angry and determined women
was set before their minds, the men laughed heartily.</p>

<p>“There’s no doubt but that Sarah’s a woman who’s
bound to have her own way,” commented the owner of
the Double Cross. “And I don’t mind a bit saying I’d
much rather it was you standing before her rifle than me.
She’s some nervous.”</p>

<p>“Well, so long’s everything is all right back at the
ranch and we’ve got two more men than we thought
you’d have, let’s have grub,” proposed Grouch. “I’m
hungry.”</p>

<p>“Sure we’ll have grub—when you overhaul our
ponies,” snapped Dude. “You start out and round ’em
up, and we’ll have a fire ready when you get back.”</p>

<p>Thus reminded that the loss of their horses also meant
the loss of their food, which was all in the saddle bags,
the avengers were thrown into no pleasant frame of mind.</p>

<p>But the two cowboys whose arrival had been so opportune
quickly restored their good humor by announcing
they had brought all the grub they could lay hands on.
And, without more ado, the men who had come so near to
a horrible death, set about having a meal.</p>

<p>Meantime, the aged scout and his two companions had
heard the fusillade of shots which had been fired at the
man they had routed from his retreat.</p>

<p>“Hooray! They’ve got the cuss!” shouted Ki Yi, gleefully,
as the reports reached their ears.</p>

<p>“Got nothin’!” snorted Nig.</p>

<p>“Why not?” demanded Deadshot. “Can’t you hear
them firing?”</p>

<p>“Uhuh!”</p>

<p>“Then what makes you say they haven’t got him?”</p>

<p>“Too many shots! Injun fool paleface! No trick um,
no keep firing! Scalping Louie heap smart!”</p>

<p>From this logic there was no getting away and, though
they stared at one another in dismay, the two cowboys
accepted the aged scout’s statement without quibble.</p>

<p>“What’s to do?” asked Deadshot, after several minutes
had brought no further comment from their guide.</p>

<p>“Find paleface.”</p>

<p>“That sounds easy, but how are we going to get out of
this hole without our ponies which the cattle drove off?”
inquired Ki Yi. “I’m not keen on walking myself, especially
when you’re liable to sink out of sight if you
don’t step just so.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we can keep hold of Nig’s rope,” rejoined Deadshot.</p>

<p>“No need walk,” grunted the aged scout.</p>

<p>“How are we going, fly?” grinned the man from the
Star and Moon. “I’m sorry, but I haven’t got my airship
with me this trip,” he added, jestingly, seeking to restore
Nig’s good humor—which the escape of his arch-enemy
through the hands of the ranchmen and cowboys
had sadly upset. “But perhaps you have one hidden in
the swamp somewhere back of us, like you did your pony,
Nig.”</p>

<p>“Paleface heap funny—nit!” snapped the old half-breed.
“Maybe no think so if Louie get um scalp.”</p>

<p>“That sure wouldn’t make a hit with me,” rejoined Ki
Yi. “But if Deadshot and me haven’t got to walk, will
you kindly tell us how we are to travel, seeing as how
we’ve only got one pony among three?”</p>

<p>“And that one so short, Ki Yi couldn’t sit it without
pulling up his knees,” added the member of the Double
Cross outfit.</p>

<p>“Pinto carry plenty easy—but slow,” responded Nig.</p>

<p>“Well, if that flea bitten bunch of hide and bones can
stand it, I reckon we can,” grinned Ki Yi.</p>

<p>But, despite his mocking words, both he and the other
cowboy glanced at the little piece of horseflesh with renewed
respect and only too thankful to be spared the
danger from a misstep which would land them in a sucking
mudhole or from being bitten by some deadly poisonous
snake, the two cowpunchers mounted behind their
aged guide.</p>

<p>The task they had undertaken, however, proved even
too much for the wily old half-breed, familiar with every
foot of the swamps as he had been. For the fire had obliterated
all the old landmarks, leaving a cover of charred
grass and saplings in its wake which hid the treacherous
deathpools, while from all about rose a steam sickening
in its stench.</p>

<p>Wondering if they would ever be able to live through
it and thanking their stars they were not obliged to walk,
the cowboys were busy looking about them when the
aged half-breed drew rein.</p>

<p>“No use. No make it,” he grunted, scanning the blackened,
foul-smelling waste. “Only paleface and fools try
go through um.”</p>

<p>“Much obliged for the comparison, but what do you
propose to do?” asked Deadshot. “We sure can’t stay
here. I believe I’d rather make a try at getting through
on foot, by myself, than dying in this hole!”</p>

<p>“Who say stay here?” demanded Nig.</p>

<p>“What else is there to do, if you say we can’t go on?”</p>

<p>“Go back.”</p>

<p>“But what good will that do?”</p>

<p>This lack of ability to grasp his purpose, disgusted the
aged scout.</p>

<p>“Say, you think Nig fool enuff to get in where only
one way get out, like paleface?” he snorted. “We turn
roun’ and go by the other trail.”</p>

<p>Chagrined to think they had both showed such a lamentable
lack of ordinary woodcraft, the cowboys looked at
one another.</p>

<p>“By thunder! we are a pretty pair!” exclaimed Deadshot.
“Here we’d clean forgotten there was any other
way to get out of this death hole. Say, Nig, it’s a mighty
good thing we’ve got you to help us or, if we didn’t show
any more common sense than we have so far. Scalping
Louie could raid all the ranches within a hundred miles
while we sat round somewhere, thinking we’d got him
cornered.”</p>

<p>“That’s no dream,” assented the man from the Star
and Moon outfit. “If we ever do get the cuss, the credit’ll
probably belong to Nig.”</p>

<p>All the while the cowpunchers were berating themselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
for their forgetting the other trails leading into the bottoms,
they were riding toward the West, and it was not
long before they found, to their delight, that the going
was easier than along the track by which they had entered.</p>

<p>“How much out of our way is this going to take us?”
inquired Ki Yi, after they had proceeded for an hour
or so.</p>

<p>“By turning to South, ’fore long, no make much more
than twenty mile.”</p>

<p>“How near will that bring us to where the cattle were
driven in?” he asked, continuing his questions.</p>

<p>“Mebbe ten, mebbe twelve mile South.”</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose you know what you’re talking about.
But I can’t see how you figure that out,” declared Deadshot.
“Here you say our having to go back and round
will take us twenty miles out of the way and yet we’ll
bring up in about ten from where we started.”</p>

<p>“Uhuh. Go West. Go South. Go North. Swamp
not all burned. Nig know trail save um going clear out.”</p>

<p>“Say, isn’t it easy when you know the answer?”
chuckled Ki Yi. “Deadshot, the best thing for you and
me to do is to keep our mouths shut before we show Nig
any more of our ignorance.”</p>

<p>And accordingly, the two cowboys held their peace
while the aged scout guided his pony with infinite skill in
and out among the death holes, turning so many times
that neither of the men at his back were able to keep any
idea of direction.</p>

<p>Several times, the member of the Star and Moon outfit
had it on his tongue’s end to ask toward which point of
the compass they were traveling, but his pride prevented
and just as it seemed to them that they were going in a
great circle, they were amazed to emerge from a clump
of saplings and underbrush and behold the plains in front
of them.</p>

<p>In delighted surprise, the cowboys gazed at the welcome
grass of the rolling prairies.</p>

<p>“I sure do take off my hat to you, Nig,” exclaimed
Ki Yi. “I’ve seen some good work in my life, but I never
saw anything equal to what you’ve done. I’m all-fired
glad it’s on Scalping Louie’s trail you are, and not mine!”</p>

<p>Though the cowpuncher had intended his words to be
complimentary, even hoping that they might restore the
aged scout’s good nature, he could not have made a more
unfortunate remark.</p>

<p>“Huh! Me on Louie’s trail some more, plenty! If
Bowser and palefaces no been heap fool, no need trail
Louie!” he grunted. “Now mebbe day mebbe week,
mebbe never—if fool sojers take um back to reservation.
No been for fool paleface, Nig had Louie by now!”</p>

<p>Though the men at his back both believed his words,
they were determined not to let him dwell upon the idea
that the presence of themselves and the other avengers
was a handicap rather than an assistance and Deadshot
quickly exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Oh, well, I don’t see how you could have got him
alone. Besides, you won’t have the hard time you think
picking up his trail again. All we’ve got to do is to find
the rest of our crowd and they’ll be able to tell us in which
direction the ornery crittur went.”</p>

<p>But the aged scout was not to be propitiated so easily.</p>

<p>“Heap good that do!” he snorted. “Paleface see
Louie go South, mebbe. Good. But while they eating
grub, thinking catch um in the morning, Louie him sneak
back and go North.”</p>

<p>“There won’t be any danger of his doing that, now
<i>you’re</i> with us,” shrewdly interposed Deadshot. “The
very fact that they can tell you in which direction Scalping
Louie went will save you just so much time in getting
on his trail because you won’t be obliged to go searching
round for it at random.”</p>

<p>Though he gave no indication either by sign or speech
that this statement was correct and appealed to him, the
aged scout, however, became less taciturn as they rode
Northward.</p>

<p>“What makes you go up instead of to the East or
South?” asked Ki Yi. “You don’t think the rest of our
bunch are fools enough to try to flee from a fire by riding
in front of it, when they could turn to one side or back
and get away, do you?”</p>

<p>“No. We go up because we find paleface waiting near
trail for us.”</p>

<p>“What, do you think they’ll sit quietly down and give
Scalping Louie the chance to get away when they can
follow him?”</p>

<p>“Paleface no follow Louie,” returned the aged scout.</p>

<p>“What makes you think that?”</p>

<p>“Wait for us. Bowser, um want wait for Nig. Nig
know. Hawk, um heap talk. No got good think cap.
Bowser, um think we come back same trail we went in,
so um wait near there.”</p>

<p>That this opinion of the clever old half-breed not alone
showed his marvelous ability to read human nature, but
was in accordance with the facts, the reader already
knows—and it was not long before the cowboys were
made aware of it also.</p>

<p>By the time the strange trio mounted upon the back of
the flea-bitten pinto had reached the plains, dusk was upon
them, which steadily increased until it was almost pitch
dark.</p>

<p>Of a sudden, as they mounted a rise in the prairies, the
aged scout pointed ahead.</p>

<p>In the distance could be seen the fitful flicker of a fire.</p>

<p>“Man, dear, you don’t suppose that could be the Midnight
Raider, do you?” eagerly inquired Deadshot.</p>

<p>“What, Louie build a fire when um know um being
hunted? Injun no such fool,” retorted Nig, with infinite
scorn in his voice.</p>

<p>“Then who is it?”</p>

<p>“No know. Think Bowser and palefaces.”</p>

<p>Unable to dispute this assertion, the cowboys held their
peace, for they realized that from the actions not only of
their bunkmates, but of themselves, they had no right to
resent the contempt for their scouting powers which the
old half-breed held.</p>

<p>From time to time, as they steadily approached, they
could see the form of some man silhouetted against the
flare, as he arose and moved about.</p>

<p>“Howling coyotes! but couldn’t we pick him off easy!”
exclaimed Ki Yi, after one of these movements which
were made without any apparent thought that there might
be enemies afoot.</p>

<p>“And he’d never know what hit him!” returned Deadshot.</p>

<p>“Say, let’s throw a crimp into the bunch!” ejaculated
the member of the Star and Moon outfit, all at once.</p>

<p>“How?” demanded his companion.</p>

<p>“Sneak up on ’em and hold ’em up!”</p>

<p>“Man, dear! But that would be good fun!” returned
Deadshot. Then, turning to the old half-breed, he asked:
“Do you think we could do it, Nig?”</p>

<p>“Uhuh! Heap easy!”</p>

<p>“Then let’s do it!” exclaimed the two cowboys, together.</p>

<p>The thought of giving Bowser and his men a practical
illustration of his ability to stalk his game, whether man
or beast, appealed to the aged scout, and readily he entered
into the joke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span></p>

<p>Without delay, the trio dismounted and Nig, by means
of a few gutteral commands, made his pinto lie down.</p>

<p>“No need cover um. So dark no one see,” he declared.
“You keep close to me. Do what me do.”</p>

<p>Having taken a thorough observation of the exact location
of the campfire, the aged scout doubled up, crouching
so low that his back could not have been seen above the
top of the grass, even if it had not been dark, and advanced,
gliding through the mesquite so skillfully that it
was nigh impossible for the cowboys to follow him. But
out of consideration for them, he paused occasionally,
giving them the opportunity to catch up to him.</p>

<p>“We must be pretty close to ’em now,” whispered Ki
Yi, after they had proceeded for some ten minutes.</p>

<p>“Uhuh. Palefaces no more thirty yards away.”</p>

<p>“Then let’s rush ’em!” exclaimed Deadshot.</p>

<p>“Get heap full lead,” returned Nig.</p>

<p>This response suggested a contingency that had not
hitherto occurred to the cowpunchers and the thought
filled them with alarm.</p>

<p>“Won’t we, anyway?” queried Ki Yi, anxiously.
“Seems to me it would be better to go back to get the
pony and then ride up, shouting to them as we came.”</p>

<p>“Not much!” returned the aged scout. “We play
um joke. Come on. Do just what I do.”</p>

<p>It was not without many misgivings, however, that his
companions followed him, as, crouching even lower than
before, Nig crept upon the unsuspecting ranchmen and
cowboys squatting about the fire.</p>

<p>When they were so near that they could not only hear
their voices but understand what was being said, the two
cowpunchers expected that their guide would play his
coup.</p>

<p>But the aged scout was determined to impress the entire
outfit with his amazing ability—and it was not until there
were scarce a foot of grass between him and his play-victims
that he paused.</p>

<p>Then, turning and signing to his companions that he
was ready to act, Nig drew his six shooters.</p>

<p>With a leap, he rose from the grass.</p>

<p>“Hands up!” he yelled, at the same time covering the
men about the fire with his guns.</p>

<p>In amazement, Bowser and the rest of the avengers
whirled in the direction whence the startling command
had come—finding to their astonishment that they were
gazing into the muzzles of six revolvers.</p>

<p class="ph3">TRACKED TO HIS LAIR.</p>


<p>So absolutely by surprise had the ranchers and cowboys
been taken that the shock seemed to paralyze their
senses and they stared at the three men glowering from
behind the death-dealing weapons as though they had
never before beheld them.</p>

<p>With difficulty, Deadshot and Ki Yi restrained their
desire to break into laughter. But so utterly crestfallen
and pitiful did their companions look that they at last
took compassion on them.</p>

<p>“Grouch, you old coyote, why didn’t you throw up your
hands, the way the gentleman told you to?” suddenly demanded
the boy from the Double Cross.</p>

<p>At the words and the ring of the voice, the men who
believed themselves in the power of the pals of Scalping
Louie started violently.</p>

<p>“Well, if it isn’t Deadshot and the others!” exclaimed
Dude, in disgust.</p>

<p>At this identification, the trio dropped their shooting
irons into their holsters and, walking to the fire, squatted
down without waiting to be asked.</p>

<p>“What on earth did you throw such a scare into us
for?” demanded Hawks, his ire rising, when he saw that
all danger was passed, to think he and his companions
had been so easily tricked.</p>

<p>“To let Nig show you just how big a bunch of dubs
you are!” retorted the member of the Double Cross outfit.
“We are sore because you let Scalping Louie get
away and so we thought we’d get even with you by proving
to you that any one could come right up to where
you were and capture you, without you so much as knowing
there was anybody round.”</p>

<p>“It’s sure one on us—and a bad one,” admitted Bowser.</p>

<p>“But how did you know Louie had got away?” demanded
Dude.</p>

<p>“Nig doped that out when he heard you firing so
much,” rejoined Ki Yi. “In addition to being the greatest
thing in the line of a scout I ever came across, he can
get the lay of any situation straighter than any one I
know.”</p>

<p>“Then, if he’s so all-fired clever, let him get out and
trail the cuss!” snapped Grouch.</p>

<p>“He will, never fear, as soon as we’ve had some grub.
We’re a bit hungry, seeing that our ponies with all our
chuck were stampeded by the cattle when we set the fire
in the swamp.”</p>

<p>“So were ours—only it was Louie who did the stunt,”
declared Dude.</p>

<p>At this announcement of the further humiliation of the
avengers, the aged scout and the two men who had
accompanied him roared with laughter.</p>

<p>“I suppose we ought to be thankful he didn’t kidnap
the bunch of you!” grinned Ki Yi, when he had
recovered from his mirth. “But from the hunger that’s
gnawing my insides, I don’t know but I’d have been
willing to swap Grouch for some food.”</p>

<p>“Don’t get too funny,” retorted the member of the
Star and Moon outfit. “If you’d been any sort of fellows,
you’d fixed Louie in the swamp and then the whole
thing would have been over, instead of just starting
in again.”</p>

<p>But no attention did Ki Yi or Deadshot pay to this
remark.</p>

<p>For just as it was finished, Pinky came forward with
some grub.</p>

<p>The sight of the cowboy they had supposed to be back
at the ranch filled them with surprise and his welcome
was none the less hearty because he appeared with food.</p>

<p>“Now, if Sandy were only here, we’d be all hunky,”
asserted Ki Yi.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m here all right,” announced the foreman of the
Double Cross, advancing to where the others could see
him.</p>

<p>And while the trio were satisfying their appetites, they
listened to the story of what had happened to their pals
who had been left to watch for the Midnight Raider, their
narrow escape from the fire and the thrilling rescue of
Bowser.</p>

<p>“Well, now that we’re all here, what’s to be done?”
asked Hawks.</p>

<p>“Better leave that to Nig, it seems to me,” returned
the owner of the Double Cross.</p>

<p>The others signifying their acquiescence by their
silence, all eyes were turned upon the aged scout.</p>

<p>“Which way Louie go?” he inquired, after enjoying
his importance for several minutes.</p>

<p>“South,” chorused two or three of the cowboys.</p>

<p>“Huh. Palefaces wait here. Nig take look round,”
returned the half-breed, and without giving them time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
to protest, he sprang to his feet and glided off into the
grass.</p>

<p>As though Dame fortune had decided to smile upon
them, the night turned out to be clear as crystal and in
due course a magnificent moon arose, bathing the plains
in her silvery light till they were almost as bright as day.</p>

<p>For a while, after the aged scout had left them, Deadshot
and Ki Yi regaled their companions with descriptions
of the man’s marvellous skill in guiding them into
and from the swamp. But as the minutes wore on without
his return, they grew silent.</p>

<p>Suddenly Deadshot sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>“I say, let’s not give the old beggar the chance to get
the drop on us again,” he exclaimed. “Ki Yi, you
Dude and Pinky watch the North, West and East, and
I’ll take the South. Challenge anything suspicious.”</p>

<p>Readily the others agreed and about an hour after taking
their posts, they were startled to hear Ki Yi shout:</p>

<p>“Out there in the grass! Who are you? Speak before
I count three—or I’ll shoot! One—t——”</p>

<p>“It’s Nig! No shoot!” quickly returned a voice, and
a moment later, the aged scout was among them.</p>

<p>“What did you find?” inquired Bowser.</p>

<p>“Louie gone to catacombs. Um hit. Found trail
blood. Paleface pony over to North, half mile.”</p>

<p>These responses brought delight to the avengers and
quickly they were afoot.</p>

<p>“Nig, you ride with Pinky and show Ki Yi, who’ll
take Sandy’s pony, where our horses are,” commanded
Bowser. “Bring ’em in as soon as you can. I sure am
itching to get on that raiding devil’s trail so I can get a
shot at him.”</p>

<p>With alacrity, the three men mounted and galloped
away, returning in a short time with all the ponies save
the one Scalping Louie had appropriated for himself.</p>

<p>Not long did it take for the ranchmen and cowboys to
mount and, with Slippery Nig riding to where he had
left his pinto with Deadshot, they again took up the
trail of the Midnight Raider.</p>

<p>Making all speed possible, scarce a word was spoken
until they came in sight of the cell-honeycombed cliff
looming in the distance.</p>

<p>“We leave um pony here,” exclaimed Nig, after taking
a careful survey of the plains that he might get his
bearings.</p>

<p>“But why? The catacombs must be all of five miles
away,” protested Hawks.</p>

<p>“Sure. But Louie, him can see man on pony heap
more easy than man in grass on foot.”</p>

<p>“That’s true enough. Yet he won’t be looking for
us, seeing that he jumped our horses on us,” returned the
owner of the Star and Moon ranch.</p>

<p>“Louie no take chances. Um know cowmen not only
ones on trail.”</p>

<p>“See here, Hen. I say we let Nig have his way,” exclaimed
Bowser. “He sure knows his business—and we
haven’t made a howling success of our part.”</p>

<p>This proposal met the ready response of the cowboys
and without more ado, they quickly dismounted, hobbled
their ponies and resumed the trail to the Midnight Raider’s
lair on foot.</p>

<p>Bending low, they advanced cautiously till they were
within some two hundred yards of the base of the catacombs.</p>

<p>“My back’s lame stooping over,” snarled the owner of
the Star and Moon. “I think this business of crouching
is all rot, anyhow. I’m going to stand up.”</p>

<p>But bitterly did the ranchman regret his decision and
heartily did his fellows curse him.</p>

<p>With an oath, the aged scout leaped upon the ranchman
to drag him down—but he was too late!</p>

<p>No sooner had Hawks’ head appeared above the grass
than a rifle barked!</p>

<p>“By thunder! He’s got me!” cried the owner of the
Star and Moon, clapping his hand to his left shoulder.</p>

<p>“Serves you good and plenty right!” retorted Bowser.</p>

<p>“Paleface more fool than coyote!” snarled Nig.
“Now we no get to catacombs till night.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” asked Sandy.</p>

<p>“Cause Louie stay on watch.”</p>

<p>But if the avengers were balked in their advance upon
the murdering Indian they had the satisfaction of knowing
that he could not escape without running the gauntlet
of their fire because the tiers of tombs had been hollowed
from a cliff and only extended three rows in.</p>

<p>Cursing the ranchman openly and under their breath,
the cowboys made themselves as comfortable as they
could and prepared to await the coming of darkness, their
guns ever at a ready, however, to pump a shot into their
quarry should he show himself.</p>

<p>Once or twice, Nig wormed his way forward, then
raised a bunch of grass suddenly, to learn whether or not
his arch-enemy was on watch. And each time a bullet
ripped it to pieces.</p>

<p>“He’s some shot!” exclaimed Dude, after the third
repetition of this feat.</p>

<p>“Have to be,” grunted the aged scout, immediately
lapsing into a silence from which no amount of questioning
could rouse him.</p>

<p>To the avengers, it seemed that never did a day have
so many hours nor the sun seem so loath to set. But at
last twilight came—and with it welcomed activity to the
manhunters.</p>

<p>“Me take Ki Yi, Deadshot and Pinky,” announced
Nig. “You left, all spread out. When we get to catacombs,
we give shot, then you set fire to grass and
watch so Louie no ’scape. We get Injun to-night—or
never!”</p>

<p>But the task was destined to prove no easy one!</p>

<p>The face of the cliff into which the tomb cells had been
cut was about three hundred feet long.</p>

<p>After stationing the five men who were again to try to
prevent the fiend’s getting away in positions some sixty
feet apart and instructing them to lie flat on their bellies
in front of the fires they were to set, in order that
Scalping Louie might not shoot them down, the aged
scout, his eyes glistening with anticipated joy at the doom
of his enemy, led the three cowboys forward.</p>

<p>Bang! went Deadshot’s gun as they reached its base.</p>

<p>Instantly, the fires flared from the plains in answer.</p>

<p>“You um take hold this rope,” ordered Nig, rapidly
passing out an end of his lariat which he had brought
with him. “Ready? Now.”</p>

<p>Yet before they could gain the entrance to the tombs,
the murdering Indian made his presence known!</p>

<p>With terrific force, a huge rock struck the ground
scarce a yard in advance of the aged scout.</p>

<p>“You be sorry! You be sorry!” hissed Nig, shaking
his fist toward the top of the cliff. “Nig know where
you are, now! You on third row tombs! We got climb
stair.”</p>

<p>As easily as though it were daylight, the aged scout
sped along the face of the cliff, then suddenly darted into
one of the openings and thankful, indeed, were his companions
that they were tied to him.</p>

<p>“We go up stair,” Nig whispered. “Get down on
hand and knee. No make noise!”</p>

<p>Obediently, the cowboys dropped to all fours and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
began the ascent of the old, seldom used rock steps. But
though they did their best, it was impossible for them
to restrain an oath or an exclamation of alarm when their
hands touched some creeping thing, now and again.</p>

<p>“We must be pretty near the sky!” breathed Pinky
after what seemed an endless climbing.</p>

<p>“That’s no place look for Louie,” returned the aged
scout. “We be on same row in jiffy.”</p>

<p>Nig’s act of speaking amazed his companions. Yet
it was done for the purpose of learning whether or not
their quarry had surmised they might mount the stairs
and be waiting to greet them with a rain of lead.</p>

<p>And the scheme worked to perfection!</p>

<p>Bang! went a gun almost before the words were finished.
But because the wily old half-breed had made
his men crawl on their hands and knees, the bullet
whistled harmlessly over their heads.</p>

<p>Expectantly, the cowboys listened for the answering
crack of the aged scout’s sixshooter. Instead, however,
they felt a quick jerk on the rope and then felt it taughten
as Nig crept forward.</p>

<p>The failure to draw fire from his pursuers worried the
Midnight Raider. Realizing full well the desperateness
of his position, he determined to learn their whereabouts
at any cost—and of a sudden he flashed a torch.</p>

<p>Taken by surprise, the wily old half-breed was not prepared
to fire and before he could do so, the hard-pressed
renegade threw away his light, and dashed down the
tier of tombs.</p>

<p>“Up! After him!” hissed Nig.</p>

<p>Quickly the cowboys obeyed, plunging blindly through
the darkness, guided only by the rope which bound them
to the aged scout.</p>

<p>In the instant that the torch had flared, Scalping Louie
had recognized the grizzled features of his arch-enemy—and
realized he must outwit him were he to escape.</p>

<p>With this purpose, he suddenly darted into the row of
tombs second from the rear wall, unwound his lariat,
made one end fast about one of the pillars and then tied
it around a pillar of the outside tier, some eighteen inches
from the floor.</p>

<p>This done, the scheming fiend glided noiselessly back to
the second row, took a position whence he could leap
upon the rope and shouted:</p>

<p>“Slippery Nig, nor you nor hundred paleface no catch
Louie!”</p>

<p>Whirling in the direction whence the taunt came, the
aged scout sped to the outer tier of tombs, then started
toward the end—and tripped over the rope!</p>

<p>With a howl of triumph, Scalping Louie was upon the
cursing, squirming mass of cowboys.</p>

<p>But he had reckoned without their strength!</p>

<p>“I’ve got him! Here he is! Quick, strike a light!”
yelled Deadshot, winding his arms about the murdering
Indian in a grip like steel, rendering the fiend powerless
to wield his scalping knife, as he had intended.</p>

<p>Yet the Midnight Raider was resourceful!</p>

<p>Realizing that should a torch be lighted his end was
come, he raised his knee with terrific force, catching
his captor full in the stomach, at the same time butting
him viciously in the chest with his head.</p>

<p>The suddenness of the move broke Deadshot’s hold
and, with a mocking laugh, the daredevil renegade dashed
for the stairway and darted to the second floor of the
catacombs.</p>

<p>“You done for now!” gloated Slippery Nig. “Quick,
boys, strike match, get torch, pick up dried twigs, grass,
anything make fire. We drive Louie out!”</p>

<p>Not understanding exactly how this was to be accomplished,
the cowpunchers nevertheless obeyed, and
when they had gathered piles of inflammable stuff, Nig
took it, crept down the stairs, placed it at the head of the
tier, thrust a match into it and as it blazed up, bounded
back to the floor above.</p>

<p>“Ki Yi, you, Pinky watch here. Deadshot come with
me. Nig know trap at other end this row. We go down.
Get Louis between fire and us—bang!—all over!”</p>

<p>Quickly the cowboys obeyed and while, with guns
ready, Pinky and Ki Yi stood guard at the head of the
stairs, the other two hastened to the opposite end of the
tier and began to work with might and main at the stone
which formed the trap door.</p>

<p>The Midnight Raider, however, heard them and, taking
his position behind a pillar, waited for a form to appear
through the opening.</p>

<p>But the aged scout was more than his match in cunning.
Anticipating this very act, as soon as he and Deadshot
raised the trap, he took off his vest and lowered it
cautiously.</p>

<p>In the darkness, the murdering Indian was only able
to distinguish some object descending—and blazed away
at it, again and again.</p>

<p>“Howl! Yell!” urged the old half-breed of his companion.
“Make believe you hit! Me lower vest some
more. You count shot. When get ten tell me. Louie
gun empty, then we drop and git um!”</p>

<p>Marveling at the cunning of the aged scout, Deadshot
obeyed.</p>

<p>And not until he had emptied both his guns and heard
his pursuers as they dropped to the floor did the Indian
fiend realize he had been outwitted!</p>

<p>But though unable to use his six shooters, Scalping
Louie did not give up!</p>

<p>Dashing to the ground tier, he awaited his chance to
dart out onto the plains.</p>

<p>“Paleface watch out! Louie coming! Set um fire up
front of tombs! He no got shells in guns!” shouted Nig,
going to the front of the catacombs.</p>

<p>Several times was it necessary to repeat the order before
Bowser and the others understood. But at last they
did and hastily began to start a line of fire along the base
of the cliff.</p>

<p>“Ki Yi, you um come down! Help Deadshot make
blaze this floor!” then ordered Nig. “Me keep Louie
from coming up!”</p>

<p>Hemmed in like a rat in a trap, the murdering Indian
faced his doom with the stoicism of his race. The surprise
of being driven from his teppee in the swamp had
forced him to flee without taking the time to supply himself
with ammunition beyond the shells he had in his
six shooters and the ones he found in the saddlebags on
the pony he stole were of a different caliber. Consequently,
though he made his way to the horse, which he
had hidden in one of the cells, he had no means to offer
resistance.</p>

<p>As the flames leaped up outside the catacombs they
made the interior of the cells as light as day.</p>

<p>“I see him! I see him!” suddenly yelled Bowser.
“Scalping Louie, you may have come near causing my
death twice—but you’ll never have another chance!”</p>

<p>Rang out the “crack!” of a rifle, a bloodcurdling
shriek—then the band of avengers from the tombs above
rushed down to make sure that the Midnight Raider had
not escaped his just doom!</p>

<p class="ph2">The American Indian Weekly</p>

<hr class="tiny">

<p class="ph3">PUBLISHED EVERY THURSDAY</p>

<hr class="tiny">

<p>This great weekly is a radical departure from all other five-cent weeklies that are now being
published.</p>

<p>It has the greatest stories of frontier life, of Indians and of the far West that have ever been
issued.</p>

<p>The stories are longer than those published in any other five-cent library, except the celebrated
<span class="smcap">Old Sleuth Weekly</span>.</p>

<p>They are all edited by Colonel Spencer Dair, the most celebrated Indian Scout, Bandit Tracker
and Gun Fighter of modern fiction.</p>

<p>A new number is issued every Thursday.</p>
